    "text": "It’s been a while since I’ve sat down to practice using R and looking through data. So this is a chance for me to shake the rust off. I’m trying to write this summary as I go through the process to document my thoughts.\nI started heading over to Kaggle and looked for any dataset I found interesting, I shortlisted a few and this one made the cut. I’ll get through the other datasets at some point.\nThere are a few reason I chose this set in particular. It’s availability was one for sure. But I’m also a recent graduate of the University of the West Indies. In a way, I still relate to being a student. Beyond that I think education is super important, especially for a people like Jamaica to improve and set themselves up. All this means I chose to take a crack at this dataset to get back into the groove.\nWithout further ado, let my load my trusty packages and get started.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n\n\nFirst I’ll bring in the data.\n\ndataset&lt;-read.csv(\"StudentsPerformance.csv\")\nglimpse(dataset)\n\nRows: 1,000\nColumns: 8\n$ gender                      &lt;chr&gt; \"female\", \"female\", \"female\", \"male\", \"mal…\n$ race.ethnicity              &lt;chr&gt; \"group B\", \"group C\", \"group B\", \"group A\"…\n$ parental.level.of.education &lt;chr&gt; \"bachelor's degree\", \"some college\", \"mast…\n$ lunch                       &lt;chr&gt; \"standard\", \"standard\", \"standard\", \"free/…\n$ test.preparation.course     &lt;chr&gt; \"none\", \"completed\", \"none\", \"none\", \"none…\n$ math.score                  &lt;int&gt; 72, 69, 90, 47, 76, 71, 88, 40, 64, 38, 58…\n$ reading.score               &lt;int&gt; 72, 90, 95, 57, 78, 83, 95, 43, 64, 60, 54…\n$ writing.score               &lt;int&gt; 74, 88, 93, 44, 75, 78, 92, 39, 67, 50, 52…\n\n\nAlrighty. So we have 1000 rows, an OK size. We have a field for race, parental education level, lunch, whether they took a test preparation course, and then their math, reading and writing scores. I notice they have placeholders for the race field, likely to reduce any bias. It’s a good move in my opinion.\nA few questions jump out at me:\n\nDo the different genders score differently?\nDo different Races score differently?\nDoes taking the test prep course make a difference?\nAre Reading and Writing Scores more closely related than Math?\n\nOf these, I’m actually most curious about the last one, so let me work through them all.\n\n\n\nThere should be a couple ways to do this. We can carry out a 2 sample t-test.\n\ndataset&lt;- dataset |&gt; mutate( mean.score = (reading.score + writing.score + math.score)/3)\ngender.t.test&lt;-t.test(mean.score ~ gender, data = dataset, var.equal = FALSE)\nprint(gender.t.test)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  mean.score by gender\nt = 4.1789, df = 997.85, p-value = 3.186e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group female and group male is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 1.979515 5.484516\nsample estimates:\nmean in group female   mean in group male \n            69.56950             65.83748 \n\n\nAccording to this, the female mean score is higher than the male mean score. The difference is statistically significant.\nI could also do an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\n\ngender.anova&lt;-aov(mean.score ~ gender, data = dataset)\nprint(summary(gender.anova))\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    \ngender        1   3477    3477   17.39 3.31e-05 ***\nResiduals   998 199591     200                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nBoth agree, there a statistically significant difference between the mean score of the male and female students. The p-value, or chance that these results are due to chance, is WAY less than 5%. At this sample size, I’d put some stock behind it.\nIn all honesty, I’d love to go through by Math, Reading and Writing to see if one particular subject has a bigger impact than the others.\n\n\n\nThe next one is a touchy topic. Thankfully the racial groups are designated with identifiers. I haven’t checked for the Key at the time of writing. A similar test can be be done. in this case an ANOVA is used to test the impact of race.\n\nrace.anova&lt;-aov(mean.score ~ race.ethnicity, data = dataset)\nprint(summary(race.anova))\n\n                Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    \nrace.ethnicity   4   7164  1790.9   9.096 3.23e-07 ***\nResiduals      995 195904   196.9                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nOnce again the results are statistically significant. Now I could do something boring and bring up the mean mean score for each group like so:\n\nd&lt;-dataset |&gt; group_by(race.ethnicity) |&gt; summarise(race.mean = mean(mean.score))\nprint(d)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  race.ethnicity race.mean\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 group A             63.0\n2 group B             65.5\n3 group C             67.1\n4 group D             69.2\n5 group E             72.8\n\n\nBut I find it may be better to do this graphically. There’s different ways to do this, but box plots are a good way to go. This plot shows the means of each racial group, but also an idea of how widely spread the scores are for each. For example, it lets you know that Race D has the second highest mean test score, but also that scores in this race are the closest together, with less variation/spread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe test prep course follows a similar analysis. The reason being that, for the purpose of this exercise, race, gender and whether the student did a test prep course are categorical variables. Students neatly fall into discrete groups.\nIn fact lets approach this one a little differently. Let’s look at it graphically first. A lot of times that’s better for intuition.\n\ntest.score.scatter&lt;-dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = test.preparation.course, y = mean.score, fill = test.preparation.course))+\n  geom_violin(alpha= 0.8, show.legend = FALSE)+\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"crossbar\", color = \"black\", width = 0.7)+\n  labs(title = \"Mean test scores of students\")+\n  xlab(\"Did they complete the test prep course?\")+\n  ylab(\"Mean Test Score\")\ntest.score.scatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom looking, you can already get a sense that those who did the prep course generally did better. More of those students had higher scores. The lower performing students of the group also performed better than the low performers who didn’t do the course. If you are less comfortable eyeballing it (and checking is always good), we can calculate the p-value with an ANOVA as above.\n\ntest.prep.aov&lt;-aov(mean.score~test.preparation.course, data = dataset)\nprint(summary(test.prep.aov))\n\n                         Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \ntest.preparation.course   1  13382   13382   70.41 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals               998 189686     190                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nIn my head, I’m curious to know whether this test prep course is paid for or if there are other entrance requirements. At any rate: the difference is once again statistically significant.\n\n\n\nNow its time for the final question. This is actually the one I’m most curious about. Are reading and writing scores more closely related than math? To me, reading and writing feel like two sides of a coin. Math seems a little further away, so I’ll see what the data says.\n\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\ntest.scores&lt;-dataset[,c(6:8)]\ncorr.matrix&lt;-cor(test.scores)\nprint(corr.matrix)\n\n              math.score reading.score writing.score\nmath.score     1.0000000     0.8175797     0.8026420\nreading.score  0.8175797     1.0000000     0.9545981\nwriting.score  0.8026420     0.9545981     1.0000000\n\n\nBut everyone loves graphs. So we’ll visualise it to tell a better story.\n\ncplot&lt;-ggcorrplot(corr.matrix, method = \"square\", type = \"lower\", lab = TRUE, title = \"Correlation matrix of student test scores\")\ncplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “redness” indicates closer relationships, as do the higher numbers. To an extent I was right. All the scores are strongly correlated. In other words students who scored one way in say, math would tend to score similarly in reading and writing. However, reading and writing were more strongly correlated than either was to math. Which is about what I assumed.\n\n\n\nThis was a good exercise to brush off the dust as far as getting back into my groove with R and analysing data. I genuinely think being able to understand statistics and data is important. While there are people who make this their whole career, I don’t think I’m there yet.\nI do think, career applications aside, I can get more use out of this. As a former lecturer of mine once repeated, “There’s lies, damn lies, and statistics” and a little understanding should help peel back some of those lies. For example, I could have hid a lot in mean score, especially if it turned out the scores weren’t highly correlated. There are still more questions that these questions unearthed.\nBut even so, I think fostering a mindset of having questions, and knowing how to start finding the answers is important. Lets hope I stick to learning and improving that aspect of my mind and skillset."

I genuinely think being able to understand statistics and data is important. While there are people who make this their whole career, I don’t think I’m there yet.\nI do think, career applications aside, I can get more use out of this. As a former lecturer of mine once repeated, “There’s lies, damn lies, and statistics” and a little understanding should help peel back some of those lies. For example, I could have hid a lot in mean score, especially if it turned out the scores weren’t highly correlated. There are still more questions that these questions unearthed.\nBut even so, I think fostering a mindset of having questions, and knowing how to start finding the answers is important. Lets hope I stick to learning and improving that aspect of my mind and skillset."

    "text": "Get to Know Me\nMy name is Matthew-Pierre Rogers, but you’ll see MP around this site. I’m a young Jamaican, a marine biologist and a lover of the ocean.\n\n\n\nMe on a Dive\n\n\nI graduated recently(2022) from the University of the West Indies and now, I am seeing how I can make the best use of my marine biology to support, not just me, but the seas of Jamaica and the wider Caribbean. Marine Biology is a pretty broad field. In fact, I think a good idea for one my first posts is on just how diverse life in the sea is, with some of my favourite organisms.\nCurrently, I work with Kee Farms, a start-up bringing seaweed farming and mariculture in general to Jamaica and the Caribbean. You’ll be hearing more about my work and adventures there as I keep posting. I’m also grateful to be accepted for an internship at the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, which will give me an opportunity to work under more seasoned marine scientists, help out with research, and tighten up my own scuba and scientific skills.\n\n\nAbout This Site\nThis is where I get to share my marine biology stories and fun facts, as well as any analysis I find cool. I find that a lot of science types have trouble communicating exactly what we do, and just how cool it is. This is my attempt to get better at that, and tell some fun stories along the way. In that sense it’s both communication, and documentation. Welcome. Glad to have you along for the ride"

    "text": "The Goals\nAt Kee Farms, to put it simply, we grow marine products like seaweed. However, we are still in the learning process. Our first batch of seaweed was depleted. So we needed a new starting crop to start growing. This meant taking a team out into the wild to find and gather some wild seaweed. Ideally, we wanted the same species of seaweed we had been growing before. Right now, we are focusing on a red seaweed known as Gracilaria . Gracilaria is a useful and popular red seaweed. Different species of Gracilaria are grown in other parts of the world. Here in Jamaica, we call it “irish moss” and traditionally for it, but our company is among the first to farm it. Here you can see some of the Gracilaria from our first round of collection dives. This specific species is called Gracilaria domingensis.\n\n\n\nSome of the Irish Moss in hand\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Irish Moss from our first trip to White Horses"

    "section": "The Start",
    "text": "The Start\nI’ll be honest. I had mixed feelings about this trip to start. Our first batch of seaweed came from a site named White Horses in St. Thomas. Its called that because the waves crashing look like..well..white horses. In other words, the water gets pretty rough. The roads to and from that site are pretty rough in their own right. The first trip was pretty rough in its own right. The second trip to White Horses was even worse. That time, the other divers and I had gotten into a mess. We collected no seaweed and almost got ourselves seriously hurt. It was a textbook case of horrible conditions. Visibility was less than three feet, surge was rough and the current pushed us towards rocks with some serious force.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as the leader for the last dive, my team and I made sure we analyzed our loss(after a beer) ad figured out what we could do better. One of the major steps was to reach our dive site early, before the water picked up for the day. We had tried to reach early on the previous trip, but due to circumstances, we didn’t reach until 1pm, when the sea was already rough.\nSo this time, we left out at 4:30 am. So after a wonderful 4 hours of sleep, we got driving. A contact had advised us of a new dive site. The drive was long, but they had done some paving on the roads. It wasn’t great, but I could see the improvement. We got to see some nice views on the ride down. Jamaica, especially the parish of Portland, is a beautiful place. Especially if you’re like me and love the sea and sea views.\n\n\n\nSunrise in Portland Jamaica\n\n\nWe kept driving and arrived around 8am. And then after stretching our legs, we got to work."

The sediment was muddy, and visibility was basically nothing(and yet somehow still better than white horses.) We could feel down and pull up the seaweed. It was another Gracilaria species, but we were more than happy to take it. We didn’t need our Scuba gear, so we set it to float at the surface. It helped keep our collection bags off the bottom as well. Then we went gathering up the irish moss. We talked and joked about crocs coming for us while we harvested. It had one of the divers so wound up she jumped at a fish, thinking it was a croc. Eventually the team, after a little more than an hour and a half, made our way back into shore.\nWe talked to some locals who told us how there was plenty of another kind of irish moss nearby and showed us the site. We loaded up our truck, and got moving.\n\n\n\nMe at the Bowden Bay, ready to gather some seaweed"

And finally we got out of the water.\nWe tried to rinse our scuba gear, as you always should. Only to find there was no freshwater. So someone working at our partners in the bay, took us to a little roadside waterfall to rinse off…which was also dry. He said he had one more option, and took us through a VERY out of the way path, to a stream where we could rinse our gear and ourselves. We had a little swim and rinse off, and started the drive home.\nAll credit for photos goes out to my team members who took them. In particular I’d love to big up Britney Williams."

    "text": "Just a brief disclaimer: This article was originally published in August 2023 on my LinkedIn. I’ve copied it over and made a few edits to drop it on my blog.\nDuring my Internship at the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, I had the honour and opportunity to pursue a research project of my own, provided I kept up with my internship responsibilities. I chose to undertake a personal project, and chose one near and dear to my heart, Seaweed Cultivation.\nSeaweed aquaculture and mariculture are topics I believe hold a lot of promise for Jamaica and the wider Caribbean. Jamaica already uses seaweeds, collectively termed “irish moss” in a number of traditional foods and beverages. To date however, the seaweeds used have all been wild harvested. This runs the risk of depleting natural stock.\nCultivating these seaweeds would give more control, help produce more consistent supply, and provide income to coastal communities. There are also several other value-added products which can be created from seaweeds. If it catches on, seaweed farming can also help remove excess nutrients from the water and help ease pressure on the local marine environment. Other territories, namely in East Africa and Asia do cultivate seaweeds, but the practice is not established in Jamaica.\nI had been interested in the topic before, and took this opportunity to explore it. My supervisor and I identified the species of Irish Moss available as Euchuema cotonii. Over the course of my internship. I reviewed existing literature, built out a simple cultivation apparatus, seeded it with Irish Moss and tended it.\n\n\n\nMe with my DIY cultivation apparatus\n\n\nThis tending usually took the form of cleaning. Every Wednesday, I would go shake the silt and sand off my seaweed. Then I would weigh it and record the data. Normally, if I was in the water, which was often, I’d check and clean the seaweed then too.\n\n\n\nWeighing the seaweed to monitor growth\n\n\nAs a scientist, I believe in using data, quantifying results and making data driven decisions as much as possible. I recorded the growth, health and appearance of my seaweed crop. I analysed and visualised the results using R. I learned a lot being in the water tending to my seaweed. And as a reward, I got to be (as far as I’m aware) one of if not the first seaweed farmers of the 21st century in Jamaica.\n\n\n\nMe with the seaweed the day I planted it out on April 14, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my friend Andrew lifting my seaweed on May 31, 2023\n\n\nFrom this you can easily see the crazy growth my crop managed to achieve. Eucheuma is cultivated around the world and known for its rapid growth, commnly said to triple in size in 6 weeks. My Eucheuma managed to match these figures. There’s a lot more detailed analysis that went into the report, but to put it simply:\nThe data and growth I recorded was more than encouraging, The possibility of cultivating seaweed in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean seems bright and hopeful. I personally intend to continue working at it, and establishing mariculture in Jamaica."

In this dataset, there are 195 rows or records. Each one represents an individual country. There are also 35 columns or fields. Each field represents a specific observation. The function in R also gives me the names and data types of these fields. Lots of the fields appear to be country demographics and general information. There’s a lot to be judged here.\nAnd from this I can see the first issue. A lot of these fields that I would expect to be numbers are formatted as characters or text. Its not an impossible problem to fix, but if it’s not dealt with, it will make doing any analysis annoying at best and impossible at worst.\n\n\nCleaning 35 columns now, saves me a lot of heartache in the future. I won’t show it all but here are some examples of how I could do that.\n\ndataset&lt;- dataset |&gt; mutate (GDP = GDP |&gt; str_remove_all(\"[$,]\") |&gt; as.numeric())\ndataset$Density..P.Km2.&lt;-as.numeric(dataset$Density..P.Km2.)\n\nThankfully, there are more efficient ways to work\n\nc.names&lt;-colnames(dataset)\ncols.to.format&lt;-c.names[-c(1,3, 9, 13, 21, 25)]\ncols.that.can.stay&lt;-c.names[c(1,3, 9, 13, 21, 25)]\ndataset&lt;-dataset |&gt; \n  mutate(across(.cols = cols.to.format,.fns = ~str_remove_all(.x, \"[$,%]\")|&gt; \n                  as.numeric()))\n\nWhat I’ve done above is to convert all the relevant character or text fields/columns into numbers so I can work with them.\n\n\n\nNow comes the brainstorming. There’s a lot of data here. A lot of the questions that come to mind have to do with GDP. GDP, the gross domestic product, is essentially the dollar value of all the “Stuff” bought and sold in a country. You could also look at it as the country’s income. It’s not a perfect measure, but it can be useful. At the very least it gives me some questions to ask.\nThe questions that pop out to me are:\n\nHow does GDP relate to college enrollment?\nHow does Gasoline price relate to GDP?\nIs there any relationship between latitude, longitude and GDP?\nHow closely are CO2 emissions and GDP linked?\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start on the first one,\n\ngdp.vs.college&lt;-ggplot(dataset, mapping = aes(y = GDP, x = Gross.tertiary.education.enrollment...., colour = Country))+\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8)+\n    xlab(\"Gross College Enrollement\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP(USD)\")+\n  ggtitle(\"GDP and Gross College enrollment across countries\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\ngdp.vs.college&lt;-ggplotly(gdp.vs.college)\ngdp.vs.college\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there’s a problem or two here. These GDP’s have a huge range. Which makes sense, some of these countries have WAY more people that others, what makes sense might be comparing the income per person instead. This is the GDP per capita. From here on out, I’ll use GDP per capita, to account for those passive population differences.\n\ndataset&lt;- dataset |&gt; mutate(GDP.per.capita = round((GDP/Population), 2)) |&gt; na.omit()\ngdp.per.capita.vs.college&lt;-ggplot(dataset, mapping = aes(y = GDP.per.capita, x = Gross.tertiary.education.enrollment...., colour = Country))+\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8)+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)+\n  ggtitle(\"GDP Per capita and College enrollment in various countries\")+\n  xlab(\"Gross College Enrollement\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP per Capita (USD)\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n  \ngdp.per.capita.vs.college&lt;-ggplotly(gdp.per.capita.vs.college)\ngdp.per.capita.vs.college\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a little better. While its scattered, and there are definitely outliers, you can definitely see an upward trend. It looks like generally, more college enrollment means more income per person. But it also looks like the more people in college the greater the effect. I suppose it means there’s more people with more knowledge and skills to mix and use to generate income together by collaborating.\n\n\n\n\ngas.vs.gdp.per.capita&lt;-ggplot(dataset, mapping = aes(x = Gasoline.Price, y = GDP.per.capita, colour = Country))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  xlab(\"Gasoline Prices per litre\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP per Capita (USD)\")+\n  ggtitle('GDP per Capita and Gas Prices Around the World')+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\ngas.vs.gdp.per.capita&lt;-ggplotly(gas.vs.gdp.per.capita)\ngas.vs.gdp.per.capita\n\n\n\n\n\nThis relationship is actually a whole lot weaker than I imagined. I wish there was electricity price or some general energy price measure instead. The relationship between gas price and GDP isn’t too strong at all. Which is fine. Sometimes the answer to a question is just “there’s nothing much to see here”.\n\n\n\n\ncord&lt;- dataset |&gt; select(\"Latitude\", \"Longitude\", \"GDP.per.capita\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Latitude = abs(Latitude)) |&gt; mutate(Longitude = abs(Longitude)) |&gt;\n  na.omit()\ncor.matrix&lt;-cor(cord)\nggcorrplot(cor.matrix, type = \"upper\", lab = TRUE)+\n  labs(title = \"Correlation between Latitude, Longitude and GDP per Capita\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s not quite as much going on in this one. The GDP per capita is kind of correlated to the latitude. But I’ve seen stronger relationships. that number in red shows us that there is something there. The closer it is to 1 and redder that square, the stronger that relationship would be.\n\n\n\nMy question here is whether the CO2 emissions of a country are strongly related to its GDP. If working to produce things for income means more CO2, then it generally follows that countries with a higher GDP should emit more.\nI’ll start off looking graphically. I find its better for intuition.\n\nCO2.vs.gdp.per.capita&lt;-ggplot(dataset, mapping = aes(x = Co2.Emissions, y = GDP.per.capita, colour = Country))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())+\n  labs(title = \"GDP per Capita and CO2 Emissions for various countries\")+\n  xlab(\"CO2 Emissions in tonnes\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP per Capita in USD\")\nCO2.vs.gdp.per.capita&lt;-ggplotly(CO2.vs.gdp.per.capita)\nCO2.vs.gdp.per.capita\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph I can see a few things. Firstly, we have a few massive outliers. If you check the far right, we see China producing tons of CO2, and the US as well. Other countries are producing far less. We also have Liechtenstein, with a very high GDP per capita with pretty low emissions. For the most part though, countries are clustered towards relatively lower emissions.\nThere are a couple ways I can sort through this, I could remove the outliers. China’s huge emissions may just be because of its huge population. I could adjust by seeing what the CO2 per person is.\n\ndataset &lt;- dataset |&gt; mutate(co2.per.capita = Co2.Emissions/Population) |&gt; na.omit()\nco2.gdp.plot&lt;-dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = co2.per.capita, y = GDP.per.capita, colour = Country))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())+\n  labs(title = \"GDP per Capita and CO2 Emissions per capita for various countries\")+\n  xlab(\"CO2 Emissions per capita in tonnes\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP per Capita in USD\")\n\nco2.gdp.plot&lt;-ggplotly(co2.gdp.plot)\nco2.gdp.plot\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’re seeing a little more detail. Correcting for the huge difference in populations made a difference. We see a general upward trend, but there are still plenty of outliers, and the relationship could be a lot stronger. There are ways to model and get more info in this relationships, but that’s a topic for later.\n\n\n\nSo, I’ll admit. This should be one of the first steps I took. In trying to put these posts out relatively fast and consistently, I may have rushed the process. There’s a life lesson in there somewhere. I could move this to the top, but I think I’ll leave it here. It will show my actual thought process as I went through this analysis, and be a reminder to go through more methodically next time. In fact, I’ll follow up with this exact data at some point in the future\nThis is a correlation matrix. I’ve used them before in my previous post here and I’m kind of fond of them. Essentially, it’s a graphical way to see how closely related two variables or properties or attributes are. It’s really applicable for numeric data, but on a dataset like this, doing one is invaluable.\n\nnumerics&lt;-dataset |&gt; select_if(is.numeric) |&gt; na.omit()\nnumerics&lt;-cor(numerics)\ngeneral.cor.plot&lt;-ggcorrplot(numerics, hc.order = TRUE, type = \"upper\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank())+\n  labs(title = \"General Correlations\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\ngeneral.cor.plot&lt;-ggplotly(general.cor.plot)\ngeneral.cor.plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “redder” the numbers, the more strongly related the variables are. For example two variables which are exactly the same would show up as the reddest. On the flip side, if two variables are related strongly, in opposite directions, they would show up the “Bluest”. These are “Negatively correlated.”\nBecause of how much data there is, I’ve opted to remove the labels and make the graph interactive. If you hover your mouse over a square, you should see the variables that are being compared.\nYou can see 3 clusters of red, showing areas of strongly related variables, and one major blue cluster showing variables which are negatively correlated. And from this there’s so many questions. Each of those clusters represent sets of relationships we could ask about. In fact, you can hover your mouse over the squares to see for yourself.\nJust hovering the mouse over each cluster:\n\nThe bottom red cluster has to do with relationships with “Birth stuff” like birth and fertility rates\nThe middle red cluster has to do with “Population size stuff”, including urban population, army size ect.\nThe top red cluster is more “Income and demographics stuff”, like minimum wage and life expectancy.\nThe blue cluster is “Birth Stuff’, connecting birth stuff to income and life expectancy\n\nSo you’ve seen my process at the moment, and some of the mistakes I’ve made. One day soon, you’ll see me re-attempt.

GDP, the gross domestic product, is essentially the dollar value of all the “Stuff” bought and sold in a country. You could also look at it as the country’s income. It’s not a perfect measure, but it can be useful. At the very least it gives me some questions to ask.\nThe questions that pop out to me are:\n\nHow does GDP relate to college enrollment?\nHow does Gasoline price relate to GDP?\nIs there any relationship between latitude, longitude and GDP?\nHow closely are CO2 emissions and GDP linked?"

These GDP’s have a huge range. Which makes sense, some of these countries have WAY more people that others, what makes sense might be comparing the income per person instead. This is the GDP per capita. From here on out, I’ll use GDP per capita, to account for those passive population differences.\n\ndataset&lt;- dataset |&gt; mutate(GDP.per.capita = round((GDP/Population), 2)) |&gt; na.omit()\ngdp.per.capita.vs.college&lt;-ggplot(dataset, mapping = aes(y = GDP.per.capita, x = Gross.tertiary.education.enrollment...., colour = Country))+\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8)+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)+\n  ggtitle(\"GDP Per capita and College enrollment in various countries\")+\n  xlab(\"Gross College Enrollement\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP per Capita (USD)\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n  \ngdp.per.capita.vs.college&lt;-ggplotly(gdp.per.capita.vs.college)\ngdp.per.capita.vs.college\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a little better. While its scattered, and there are definitely outliers, you can definitely see an upward trend. It looks like generally, more college enrollment means more income per person. But it also looks like the more people in college the greater the effect. I suppose it means there’s more people with more knowledge and skills to mix and use to generate income together by collaborating."

And after a year working with the people there, I can confirm that’s more than just a tagline to them. The team by AHF works for community development, marine conservation and marine research.\nAHF has several initiatives they are a part of, you can check them out here, but what I want to mention specifically is their fish sanctuary, and their dive shop."

Technically, it’s “The East Portland Special Fisheries Conservation Area”, but I find sanctuary has a nicer ring to it.\nFor context, my country, Jamaica, has the most overfished water’s in the English speaking Caribbean. We are also a small island state where more than half of us live within 5km of the coast. With a mix like that, you can see that our fish populations are under serious pressure.\nAnd to that effect, Jamaica has established a number of Fish Sanctuaries. The basic idea is pretty simple. An area is designated a no take zone. Within the bounds of the sanctuary almost no fish can be legally taken. This means that the fish living inside have room to grow and mature and reproduce. Once these fish are of a sufficient size, they move out of the crowded sanctuary and are available to be fished and caught.\nIt’s a sustainability measure, and it improves fish numbers and size (or fish biomass) inside and directly outside the sanctuary. AHF’s sanctuary is among the larger ones in Jamaica and through working with the fishing community, they help ensure sustainability for generations to come.\nI did say almost no fish can be caught, with permission, one invasive species can be caught with the sanctuary. The lionfish. These guys aren’t native to the Caribbean, and eat a lot of our native species, so to control their numbers we return the favour and eat them back. I can personally confirm that they are delicious.\n\n\n\nConfirmation that Lionfish is Delicious"

As a sanctuary, the area has more fish and larger fish then you would see in the surrounding areas. The area is also teeming with other wildlife. I’ve seen rays and turtles just passing by while I’m above water on the boat.\n\n\n\nThe beautiful blue waters at San San in the Sanctuary. You may see a turtle if you look closely\n\n\nI’m a simple diver, a reef with lots of pretty fish already gets me excited. But this dive shop also has even more special attractions I’m dying to jump in the water and see.\nFirst is their underwater statue garden. They have a number of statues underwater for us scuba divers to explore. It’s the only one in Jamaica and I can’t wait to dive it. All I need is time, an opportunity and a few good dive buddies.\nThe second is a little newer. There was recently a wreck sunk in the sanctuary, the SS Bogle. This decommissioned Jamaica Defence Force ship was sunk in the sanctuary, and now serves as an artificial reef, with fish coming in to colonise and live there. I’ve done a wreck dive before on my advanced open water certification, and I loved that experience. I’m absolutely jumping at the chance to dive this wreck as soon as I can.\nMy favourite dive site is Rio Bueno near Discovery Bay, Jamaica, I’m hoping diving with Lady G’ will change that.\n\n\n\nMy Last Wreck Dive, a 10/10 experience\n\n\nThere’s also water sports like glass-bottom boat rides over the reef, kayaking and snorkeling for the non divers among us. Of course you could get certified at the dive shop, and become a diver like me.\nI promise I’ll review diving in the sanctuary as soon as I do it. You’ll be seeing pics, hearing my thoughts and everything.\nAnd I haven’t even mentioned what may be the best thing about AHF yet. I love the team working there. I’ve made friends with the staff and team there. They’re just really cool, solid people and they’re out there working to protect and sustain the sea like me.\nI haven’t mentioned everything, like their outreach activities, or their turtle hatching program, or their amazing coral nursery and planting. But even just from this you can tell I have nothing but praise and good vibes for the team at AHF and the amazing work they do.\nUntil next time, walk good."

    "text": "Why do divers even have logbooks?\nSome of you might be asking what even is a diver’s logbook, or why we keep them. Logbooks are where divers record logs of their dives. They are pretty common, and pretty much all divers are taught to keep them when we are getting trained(although some of us definitely fall off track.)\nLogbooks are meant for us diver’ to track our progress and improvement and remember our fun dives. We usually record things like:\n\nThe dive site\nThe depth(maximum depth, or average depth or both)\nThe time we were underwater\nThe conditions underwater(are the waves and currents strong? How far can you see?)\nThe amount of gas we use on the dive\n\nOther things we include might be any wildlife we saw, any equipment we used and personal notes or feelings about the dive.\nWe don’t all use physical logbooks, in 2023 there are a number of apps available. Still some people do still find it satisfying to log their dives on pen and paper…at least to a point.\n\n\n\nMy beat up Log Book has seen a couple dives, and will be seeing a couple more\n\n\nFirst lets prepare. As always, I’m using R for analysis. I’ll load the packages I need from R.\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata)\n\n\nLets read in the data, look around and see what this person recorded:\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\nDataset&lt;-read.csv(\"scuba_diving_logbook - cleaned_data.csv\")\nglimpse(Dataset)\n\n\nRows: 445\nColumns: 15\n$ id                &lt;chr&gt; \"2H\", \"3H\", \"4H\", \"5H\", \"6H\", \"7H\", \"8H\", \"9H\", \"10H…\n$ date              &lt;chr&gt; \"2005-01-16\", \"2005-05-01\", \"2005-05-22\", \"2005-07-1…\n$ category          &lt;chr&gt; \"Hobbies\", \"Hobbies\", \"Hobbies\", \"Hobbies\", \"Hobbies…\n$ country           &lt;chr&gt; \"France\", \"France\", \"France\", \"France\", \"France\", \"F…\n$ city              &lt;chr&gt; \"Marseille\", \"Marseille\", \"Cassis\", \"Marseille\", \"Ma…\n$ site              &lt;chr&gt; \"Les moyades\", \"La grotte mystérieuse\", \"Les pierres…\n$ gps_position_lat  &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ gps_position_long &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ maritime.location &lt;chr&gt; \"Mediterranean sea\", \"Mediterranean sea\", \"Mediterra…\n$ stand             &lt;chr&gt; \"Boat\", \"Boat\", \"Seaside\", \"Boat\", \"Boat\", \"Boat\", \"…\n$ type              &lt;chr&gt; \"Technical\", \"Exploration\", \"Technical\", \"Exploratio…\n$ circuit           &lt;chr&gt; \"Open circuit\", \"Open circuit\", \"Open circuit\", \"Ope…\n$ gas               &lt;chr&gt; \"AIr\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Ai…\n$ duration.min.     &lt;chr&gt; \"43\", \"37\", \"57\", \"48\", \"33\", \"48\", \"37\", \"46\", \"47\"…\n$ depth.m.          &lt;chr&gt; \"24,5\", \"17\", \"18,1\", \"16\", \"19\", \"25\", \"23\", \"21\", …\n\n\nThat’s a start. There’s well over 400 dives here. I’m impressed. The person has also recorded the location, coordinates, how they entered the water and the depth and time they were underwater. I would have expected to see the amount of gas they used, but we work with the data we have. A couple of the numbers I’d like to work with are saved as text. They’ll need to be converted before I can begin.\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\nDataset &lt;- Dataset |&gt; mutate(depth.m. = as.numeric(depth.m.)) |&gt;\n  mutate(duration.min. = as.numeric(duration.min.)) |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))\n\n\nOnce that sorted. I can get into the questions.\nThere are really two major questions I can get from a set like this. If I had them in person, I could ask about gear, their favourite dives, all sorts of things. But as it stands, my two big questions are:\n\nWhere have they been diving?\nHow much diving have they done?"

    "section": "Where have they been diving?",
    "text": "Where have they been diving?\nLet’s see where this diver has been. I’m going to look at this at a country level. This is partly for simplicity, and partly because personally, I want to dive in other countries so I want to see where this person has been.\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\nD&lt;-Dataset |&gt; select(country, id) |&gt; group_by(country) |&gt; \n  tally(name = \"no.dives\") |&gt;\n  rename(\"region\" = \"country\")\n\ncountry.dives&lt;-ggplot(D, mapping = aes(x = region, y = no.dives, fill = region))+\n  geom_col()+\n  ylab(\"Number of Dives\")+\n  xlab(\"Country\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Number of Dives in Each Country\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")\ncountry.dives&lt;-ggplotly(country.dives)\ncountry.dives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I think graphs, especially interactive ones like this are way better than plain text for communicating data. Like I’ve mentioned, it just communicates a lot more intuitively, at least it does for me. But there’s other ways to tell the same story. For example, I’m going to try something completely new, and communicate the same data above like this:\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\nworld&lt;-ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\nD&lt;-Dataset |&gt; select(country, id) |&gt; group_by(country) |&gt; \n  tally(name = \"no.dives\") |&gt;\n  rename(\"name\" = \"country\")\nmap.data&lt;-left_join(world, D, by=\"name\")\nfill.map&lt;-ggplot(map.data, aes(fill = no.dives, text = paste(\"Country: \", name, \" \\nDives\", no.dives)))+\n  geom_sf()+\n  ggtitle(\"Places this person has dived\")+\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"number of dives\", low = \"cyan\", high = \"blue\", na.value = \"white\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\nfill.map&lt;-ggplotly(fill.map, tooltip = \"text\")\nfill.map\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this is the best way to show the data. There are some caveats. I figured this out while coming up with the post, so there’s still a good deal of skill left to pick up. A huge part of my writing is being authentic though, so any readers (and myself) can see how far I come in the process.\nWith that said, let’s glance at the map itself. You can hover over it with your cursor to see the name and number of dives for a specific country. You can also click and select areas to zoom in for more detail. If you zoom into the Caribbean, you’ll find a few other sites that are hidden by size.\nIf I wasn’t sure before, I’m pretty sure this is a french diver now. Most dives are in France, and a good chunk of the rest are in fresh-speaking territories. They’ve gone overseas on some dive trips I would love to. Up until now, I’ve only dived in Jamaica, and not even everywhere here.\nJust from the sheer number of dives, I know this person is a far more advanced diver than me. I want to see some of the depths and times of their dives. As a PADI Advanced Open Water Diver, I’m currently limited to 40 metres deep. I have a suspicion this diver has gone a bit further with their training and skills.\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\ntime.and.depth&lt;-ggplot(Dataset, mapping = aes(x = depth.m., y = duration.min., colour = gas))+\n  geom_point()+\n  xlab(\"Depth (metres)\")+\n  ylab(\"Duration of dive (minutes)\")+\n  labs(title= \"Depth and Duration of Dives\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ntime.and.depth&lt;-ggplotly(time.and.depth)\ntime.and.depth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here I can tell this is an advanced diver. Well, I could tell before, but this is confirmation. The number of dives is a huge indicator, but ignoring that, there are two things revealed here that give it away.\n\nThis diver has a number of gas mixes. With special training, divers can learn to use different air to affect how long they stay underwater.\nThis diver is pulling some crazy times and depths.\n\nThis diver is using air for some dives, those are the pink ones. And those fall into the range I’ve done and expect. Those dives are generally 40 metres or less, for under 100 minutes. They are also using Nitrox, a gas with more oxygen mix, and Trimix another altered gas.\nThe general rule is that it’s the nitrogen in your breathing gas that poses the most danger, so by changing that percentage, you can start to manage depths and times you never could on air. This definitely a more advanced diver, well beyond recreational limits."

But I do take note of some stuff not seen here like my gas consumption and animals I’ve seen. That would absolutely be great data to play with.\nBut also in the future, I’d love to go on dive trips like this. The rest of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico would be a great start, but diving the Mediterranean like this diver, and Indonesia would definitely be dreams come true.\nAnd you know what, I’ll do it. It will take planning, and saving, but I’ll do it.\nUntil next time, Walk Good"

    "text": "Just what affects my Salary?\nI’d like to frame this post a little differently. As much as I like making pretty charts, the benefit of this data is really being able to make better decisions. While it may not predict the future exactly; more knowledge, especially more useful knowledge, helps us make better choices. More effective choices are what help us meet our goals, no matter who we are.\nSo I’ll put myself in the position of someone else, and invite you to join with me. Firstly, I’d like to think of myself as a young professional interested in this company. I want to know what matters to get my salary as high as it can be.\nClearly other things matter. For example, job satisfaction is important. Exactly how much money you are willing to trade off for job satisfaction is a personal choice. In this case, I’ll assume our imaginary professional only cares about their salary for now.\nI know from above that the salary is linked pretty heavily to projects completed, so, I’ll look into that. Right away you see the benefit of exploring the data, I know where to look, and don’t have to search for every possible connection since I have general direction.\n\n\nCode\nsalary.age.plot&lt;-ggplot(Dataset, mapping = aes(x = Projects.Completed, y = round(Salary), colour = Department))+\n  geom_point(alpha= 0.8, size = 1.2)+\n  labs(title =\"Plot of Salary and Projects completed at a certain company\")+\n  xlab(\"# Projects Completed out of 25\")+\n  ylab(\"Salary\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format())+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = FALSE))\nsalary.age.plot&lt;-ggplotly(salary.age.plot)\nsalary.age.plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright. There’s a pretty good figure. You can clearly “see” the line running down the middle of those points and there’s a definite relationship. As an employee here, completing projects definitely helps improve my salary. So I can take steps there to get my salary up here.\nBut that’s not the only question I can ask. Lets say (for arguments sake) I’m a woman. I want to know if at this company, I’m likely to make less than a man working here, on average.\n\n\nCode\nGender.Wage.Boxplot&lt;- Dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Gender, y = Salary, fill = Gender))+\n  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format())+\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot showing salaries in a certain company by gender\")+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\nGender.Wage.Boxplot&lt;-ggplotly(Gender.Wage.Boxplot)\nGender.Wage.Boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (Please note that when I say average in this context, I mean median. Medians are less distorted by huge outliers at the top or bottom. Still, Things hide in averages, I’ll go just a little deeper. After all, this is our salary I’m talking about.)\n\n\nCode\ngender.hist&lt;-ggplot(Dataset, mapping = aes(x = Salary, fill = Gender))+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format())+\n  ggtitle(\"Salary Distribution by Gender\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank())\nprint(gender.hist)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell then. Now I can see that the average woman makes more than the average man in this company, especially around that $100 000 range. The men seem to have higher outliers, or a few at the top making way more money, but they do make less on average. At any rate, being a woman doesn’t hurt my salary prospects on average.\nFinally, If I want to make more money, what department should I focus on? In practice, it depends on my skillset, job openings and all that, but for this exercise, let’s see what can help me maximize my salary,\n\n\nCode\nDepartment.Wage.Boxplot&lt;- Dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Department, y = Salary, fill = Department))+\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8, notch = TRUE)+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format())+\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot showing salaries in a certain company by department\")+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\nDepartment.Wage.Boxplot&lt;-ggplotly(Department.Wage.Boxplot)\nDepartment.Wage.Boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes it easy to see. The I.T department has the highest average salary. Finance also has a pretty good average salary, and the highest “floor” or low end salary in the company. Now, as a prospective applicant, I would know where to focus. Finance and IT are pretty close though. At this point, the choice might well come down to job satisfaction(even though I said we didn’t care).\n\n\nCode\nDepartment.Satisfaction&lt;-Dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Department, y = (Satisfaction.Rate..../100), fill = Department))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  labs(title = \"Job Satisfaction by Department\")+\n  ylab(\"Satisfaction Rate (%)\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format())+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\nDepartment.Satisfaction&lt;-ggplotly(Department.Satisfaction)\nDepartment.Satisfaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat might make the difference for I.T as our professional. A little extra job satisfaction for what’s basically the same pay.\nOn the other hand, If i was an employer/manager, This info would help with hiring. I’d know who to pay attention to, and which staff are most important to retain. I’d also know which departments on my team are the least and most satisfied. It might even explain things like employee turnover I might be dealing with."

    "text": "Brief Summary\nSo, Just to give a brief rundown of the last year. Since graduating, I’ve started work with a Start-up in my field. There’s other posts around the blog (see here) about stuff i’ve done with the company. The start-up is Kee Farms, a relatively young company aiming to combat climate change through regenerative ocean farming. The company is young as well, so it’s as much of a leaning curve for me as it is for them. I’ve learned more about how things are done than the technical marine biology here.\nI’ve also done an internship with the Discovery Bay Marine Lab. This lab is located in St Ann, Jamaica. The lab has an internship program taking in two cycles of interns per year. Normally these include the recent graduates from the Marine Biology program at the University of the West Indies, but it is open to interested international students. This was one of my first times away from home for so long. It was also a chance to work with more seasoned Marine Biologists. The lab taught us quite a few skills and tools, but they also exposed us to research, teaching and outreach. In the process, the interns could get a feel of what worked best for us and what we gravitated towards.\nFinally, in the process, I’ve decided on a rough area of marine biology I’m interested in. I’ve suspected for a while where in marine biology I’d love to focus on in an ideal world. At the current moment, aquaculture is where my interest lies. I love the idea of putting knowledge to work, actually applying it to produce something, and aquaculture fits that perfectly right now. Time alone will tell how far I go with it, but I’m definitely going as of right now."

I know so many STEM students (especially those out of computing) who are nowhere near what they studied. Heck, one of my best friends studied bio medical engineering (building drugs and stuff) and is outside the field trying to break in. And that’s after migrating. STEM careers get a lot of hype, but especially in small developing countries, the fields are crowded. And its never that we don’t need developing in those STEM related areas, the space just never seems to materialise and its discouraging for so many of my cohort.\nI’ve managed to be on the water and in the water over the last year. I picked the field in part because I love the feeling of being out at sea. I don’t think I’m meant for a job permanently behind a desk. So I appreciate and I’m grateful for the fact I’ve gotten to go out on and under the water. The Discovery May Marine Lab was great for this, and to this day, most of my favourite marine memories are at (and under) the sea there.\nI’ve done hands on, practical work. Maybe this one’s part of being a covid student but I missed a chunk of my schooling experience due to the pandemic. I’m glad especially for the Discovery Bay internship, that helped me get out and do a lot of the nitty gritty work. I didn’t love all of it at the time, I don’t even love all of it now. But I appreciate that I got to make up for lost time. It was definitely a growing experience.\nBut beyond a shadow of a doubt, my favourite thing one year after graduating is that I can look back and see new skills I’ve cultivated over the year. I’m now an advanced open water diver. I’ve taught myself a good deal of R. I’ve learned to do a couple in water surveys. I can roughly ID some fish at a glance, way way more than I could a year ago. I did my first pitch for a company at PitchDeckJa. I pushed myself to do new things and honestly, I’m glad I did. The learning had just begun and even a year out of graduating, I have so much more learning to do."

    "text": "What I Don’t Like\nThis is absolutely not all sunshine and rainbows though. There’s not a ton of organisations out there for science in developing countries like Jamaica. Someone I respect, with a few years more experience than me, from DBML has told me its absolutely getting better compared to back in his day, but there’s still only so much room.\nThat means a couple things. Firstly, there’s a good chance you’ll have to move more than you like. This may be within the country. I’ve seen some parts of Jamaica I’ve never seen before. But you still miss home if you are like me. If you’re less lucky, you may have to leave your country entirely.\nPersonally, developing and helping Jamaica means something to me. And leaving may be the best way to do that. But It may also mean you leave and never return to settle and contribute the way you want. Heck, I’m still coming to terms with that and trying to hold on.\nThe few organisations means you’re competing. Against your cohort yes, but also for funding. There’s only so much money to go around, especially if your science is more theoretical, or requires infrastructure which is lacking in your country. A good chunk of work may actually end up being just writing and calling and trying to figure out that funding.\nIts hard and its not for everyone. But for those who can (resource and ability wise), you may need to start something for yourself and create your own seat at the table so to speak. This is absolutely not easy, and not for everyone in the slightest. It may be needed though.\nFinally, related to that is people. You’ll have to deal with people regardless of what you do, but if you want to make your own seat at the table you’ll need to deal with it even more. I was sort of prepared for doing science…sort of. But I was unprepared for just managing the people and relationships that can grow up in a small field where everyone knows everyone. Again, I’m talking about marine biology in Jamaica, but I imagine it would be the same for a lot of other STEM fields in developing countries. It’s definitely not something I thought about off the top of my head."

    "text": "What I’d Change/Advice\nHere comes the last part. Advice. Here’s what I’d tell myself(or anyone where I was a year ago), about to graduate with my degree.\n\nKeep learning\nBe more than just a scientist\nReach out to people\n\nFirstly, keep learning. Graduating doesn’t mean you know everything. It doesn’t even mean you know most things. It means you’ve learned how you learn best, and have enough of a foundation to learn something else new. So keep learning. Pick up little bits from whatever you’re interested in and whatever opportunities come your way. That’s how you figure out where you’re going. Where I am right now, I’m considering dipping my toes into a whole other section of the biological sciences to enhance my existing skillset.\nOn that note, don’t just learn STEM stuff. We need scientists who are more than just scientists. I’m not proclaiming to be an expert but here are some of the top skills I think fresh grads should dip our feet into:\n\nWriting and communication: this is good for grants, proposal and getting your work out there. NEVER ever discount the skill of being able to tell a good story.\nBasics of finance/accounting: Sourcing and managing money to do your science(without being scammed)\nProject Management: Learn to approach and carry out projects(like research) in an organised way.\n\nFinally. talk to people. Offer to help with things. Even if its a cold message to someone you don’t know, put yourself out there aggressively. Let other people reject you, but don’t discount yourself. You’d be amazed how willing people are to talk to someone younger who seems to have a good head on their shoulders. You’d be even more surprised the benefit you can get from an experienced mentor who wants to see you succeed.\nFeel free to follow up. This post was to me a year ago, but its also for any upcoming grads in Jamaica or other developing countries. If you have any Questions, message me on Linkedln, Twitter, or my Email, and I will do my best to get back to you soon.\nWalk Good and Happy New Year."

I’ve read books on personal development like The Four Agreements and Mastery. I’ve read a little bit on one of Jamaica’s National Heroes, my personal favourite, Marcus Garvey for the first time. It turns out he said a lot I agree with and a lot I don’t.\nI’ve read books that are “classic” and hard to qualify like Meditations. And of course I’ve read my fiction as well. Neil Gaiman’s Anansi Boys is probably my favourite book so far, although comparing fiction to non fiction is like apples and oranges. Separate from books like these, I’ve made an effort to read…\n\nAcademic Reading\nI’ve asked around online for good ways to keep growing and learning after finishing university. It’s something I was really concerned about. I want to keep improving, and not be an “ok” marine biologist, but the best one can I be. At the same time, I’m very aware of how easy it is to stagnate, or worse forget what you aren’t actively using. So I’ve made an effort to find some material in my field(marine biology, specifically aquaculture), and try to read through a couple papers a week.\nI decided to try and keep the number low so I can actually engage with them properly. Occasionally I stray outside the field(usually somewhere adjacent), but I’m glad to say I’m being pretty consistent. I’ve put in my own money and subscribed to a journal and I’ve not regretted it yet.\nOne thing I’ve taken to doing is using an online tool called Notion, to help me keep track. Notion is huge, and can do a lot of things. It is potentially a very big system, but to be honest, all I use it for right now is as a library for the literature I read. It’s also free(or I use a free version which has pretty much everything but limits sharing).\nI use this template some kind soul came up with online and record the titles, links and broad topics of the papers I’ve read. Then I’ll write my summaries, insights and ideas into the program, and everything will get stored online. I personally find summarising and engaging like that makes me remember more than just glancing through passively.\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the library where I keep papers i have read, with summaries and citations."

But I’m shocked just how much people have done that I have not and would not have heard of otherwise. The knowledge is out there, just waiting for someone to tap it. Maybe you can do something practical with it like I hope to, but you can definitely learn.\nBut I learn a lot from fiction too. It’s like meeting the characters(and the authors). I’d argue some of the personal development I’ve seen in/learned from characters is as important and useful as the advice in any self help book. There’s a reason children are taught with stories.

It’s easiest to build habits with something you like or something rewarding. Maybe you have a favourite series based on a book, you can start there. Or find some easy reading, whatever that means to you. Don’t feel any sort of way that your choice is silly. Its a story you like, that’s valuable enough.\nWith that said, I’m going to keep reading.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On this blog post I want to talk about connection. This will, admittedly, be a bit of a strange post. It’s something I’ve never really done before, mixing in my Marine Biology with a little…lets call it philosophy.\nI was trained as a marine biologist. As anyone who knows me, or who has taken a look around the blog should be able to tell. But the truth is marine biology is just the study of living things in the sea. There’s a hundred and one ways to approach it.\nVery broadly, If i had to condense down my training, I’d say I was trained as an ecologist. What ecologists primarily focus on is the interaction between living things and their non living environments. I was trained with a focus towards how the oceans’ living things and environment interact, and consequently, how they are connected. Just to be clear, that is still a super broad area of knowledge, but it is a starting off point.\n\n\n\nA simple food web, showing how livings things connect, directly or indirectly\n\n\nPicture of a Marine Ecosystem and food web\nNothing in nature exists in a vacuum. Everything is connected, whether directly or indirectly. The matter we are made up of right now has been cycling, from place to place and organism to organism for thousands of years. The energy we’re running on flows from the sun, to other organisms to us. In short, we are all connected. In fact, if you take a wide enough view, pretty much everything is connected.\nIn fact, what we think of as “a single thing”, very rarely is. There’s a concept in biology called symbiosis, where two organisms interact particularly closely, to the benefit of (at least) one. Organisms we consider one, often have bacteria and microbes which play a small(or large) part in keeping that organism running smoothly. Tree’s associate with fungi to extend their roots, and corals associate with algae to provide their food.\nThe truth is, everything is connected, and nothing truly exists in isolation. That’s not just the plants an animals. The more I grow, the more I realise the field itself has tons of connections.\nAfter all, marine biology involves knowing about the water(chemistry), the land below the sea(geography), the physics of water 30 metres down(especially as a diver) and the microbes in the sea and sand(microbiology). Biotechnology is an increasingly important part of the space, and as with everything else, economics plays a role.\n\n\n\nAll these fields are connected in ocean science. Its basically impossible to do one without touching another\n\n\nBeing a marine biologist, trying to be a good one, has meant knowing a bit about all of these. I’ll need to keep learning, no question. And yet, there’s only so much one person can know well.\nOne of the big things I picked up from the Econ minor is the value of specialisation. We do our best, by focusing on something, and doing it extremely well. Then, when we collaborate, we accomplish far more than we could do on our own.\nThat’s where networks and teamwork comes in. As a proud West Indian, I have to mention the Caribbean Aquaculture Hub. It was the idea of Dr. Julie Russo, someone I know personally and have great respect for. She saw the very real need to bring together all the scattered skills, professionals and stakeholders in aquaculture across the Caribbean and world. After a little more than a year in the caribbean and marine science space, I see just how needed this is.\n\n\n\nLogo for the Caribbean Aquaculture Hub\n\n\nA network like this allows people to share knowledge and build on what others are doing far more effectively. It would allow people to connect with specialists and new ideas in a way that innovates and new ways of doing aquaculture that work best for our region. It would give a united front to approach governments or companies abroad. And it would make it easier for the natural potential and talent of us Caribbean people to be truly utilised.\nSo I’m giving of my time. I’ll be taking an active role with the students and young people in the organisation. I want to help build this community that will make things better for me and all of the young up and coming Caribbean scientists. I want to help bring together not just marine scientists like me, but all the other areas we are connected to, to create a resilient, highly productive ecosystem for Caribbean Aquaculture and Marine Science.\nAnd hey, If this is something you want to be a part of reach out to me here or here or the network itself. It doesn’t matter if you’re a student, professional or just find it cool. After all, we’re all connected, and its going to be that connection(with people in the space, and ones we traditonally think of as outside), that’s going to create something strong and beautiful."

    "text": "Setting the Stage\nLet’s start off with the basics. What is coral? Despite looking like a rock, Coral is an animal (technically a colony of animals). Corals are closely related to jellyfish, and while there are tons of corals, when scientists say it, they are typically referring to hard, stony corals. When I say corals these are what I’m referring to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA collage of Atlantic coral from online. Corals differ by ocean and I now subconsciously look if I’m seeing corals I recognize anytime I see coral\n\n\nCorals are found in the tropics, so areas like my home Jamaica traditionally have coasts full of coral. They have reasonably strict living requirements:\n\nCorals prefer warm(but not hot) water\nThey need clear sunlight, and so prefer shallow water\nSeawater without any freshwater\nWater with sufficient Calcium to build their skeletons\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Distribution of coral reefs, you can see they love the tropics\n\n\nThey tend to accumulate in coral reefs, rocky formations which, personally I think are the most beautiful environment in the sea. These reefs are formed by corals growing atop each other."

    "text": "Why do these matter?\nNot only are these reefs absolutely gorgeous, they are homes. The nooks and crannies made by the corals growing serve as habitat for the fish and other organisms that live on the reef.\n\n\n\nA colony of Porites/finger coral I photographed with sponges growing on it\n\n\nAnd believe me, There’s a lot of organisms on the reef, the usually quoted figure is that 25% or 1 in 4 marine animals spend some part of their lives on the reef. That includes tons of the fish we eat. In fact, here in my home country at least, pretty much all our traditional fish are reef dwellers.\n\n\n\nA School of blue chromis a 100 feet down. 1 in every 4 marine animals live on coral reefs at some point in their lives\n\n\nThis seems like a good place to talk about another thing corals do. While they are animals (I wouldn’t lie to you), they do look like rocks. They are tough enough to break waves coming in to shore. I’ve been on both sides of a reef helping students and we can all confirm, the forereef (the side facing out to the deep sea) is way rougher than the backreef (where the waves have been broken). This applies to regular waves, but also storm surges. A healthy reef protects what’s behind it, and what’s behind it is often our land and home and buildings.\nSo by now, you can see corals help give fish(or seafood) places to live and grow, and protect the shore from storms and harsh waves. That’s already plenty. But I’ve mentioned they’re gorgeous, and people (like me), will pay money to go dive and see the reef and its residents.\nSo it seems like corals are a win-win-win. Which means this is where I drop the bad news."

    "section": "The Bad News",
    "text": "The Bad News\nRemember when I said coral was an animal? It is, but its also more. If you want to get technical, what we refer to as coral is usually a partnership between a jellyfish-like animal (polyp), and tiny plants (zooxanthellae or dinoflagellates). The plants give the coral its gorgeous colour, and provide it with food. In exchange, the corals provide them with homes and protection. And those plants do that job really well. Under normal circumstances, the plants provide all the energy the coral needs and it barely has to feed on things drifting by in the water with its tentacles. Those plants are the reason the corals need clear, shallow water and plenty of sunlight.\nBut it can backfire. When temperatures get too hot, or the corals are otherwise stressed they eject their tiny plants. Like I said, the plants give them their vibrant colour, so they turn a haunting, bony pale white when they are lost, a process called bleaching. They don’t die immediately, and if the stressor subsides, they can even take back up new plants into their cells. But if it persists. They will die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBleached staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis. It looks haunting, but can spell death for the reef. I didn’t take this picture, which is good since I’d likely be heartbroken\n\n\nAnd reefs take centuries to grow. The heat contributes to bleaching. In recent years, we’ve had bleaching events back to back to back. I will likely never see a reef the way my mentors did, and yet, that I may be one of the last divers to see a live reef.\nWe’re fighting back. The scientists, conservationists and other groups are trying, I personally know several who are, but Its a scary and sobering thought that I may be one of the last humans to dive a reef, and see an ecosystem that quite literally built and sheltered my island."

So here’s a short list of some things we can do.\n\nGo visit an aquarium. Go see for yourself. Tons of them have sharks in tanks with other fish, kinda disproves the whole “eats anything in front of it” myth. Ask questions about them. Learn more.\nShare articles and stories like these. Talk to people who know a bit about sharks. Start chipping away at that fear of the unknown.\nTell better stories. I’ve been harping on the fact that media portrayal has a lot to do with how we see sharks. But we have the power to tell better stories. Heroic sharks… shark stories like that could do as much good for the sharks’ image as works like “Flipper”, “Free Willy” or “A Dolphin’s tale.\n\nSo let’s try to learn a little more, so we can fear a little less about sharks. They are worthy of a healthy respect, so you and I can start by giving them that respect and letting it take the place of the fear.\nWalk good."

Now let’s get into the bit that’s exciting.\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look then. Firstly, I will look at how much Frank’s Fisheries caught each year. Then I get to begin turning data into a story.\n\n\nCode\ntotal.landings&lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\")) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_catch = sum(weight_kg)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = total_catch)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#248a9c\")+\n  #geom_point(size = 1.8, alpha = 0.8, colour = \"#248a9c\")+\n  #geom_line(colour = \"#248a9c\")+\n  labs(title = \"Frank's Fisheries Shows Record Breaking Catches in 2014\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Total Catch(kg)\",\n       caption = \"After a decline and 3 years downtime ending in 2009, landings have grown to an all time high in 2014\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n#total.landings&lt;-ggplotly(total.landings)\ntotal.landings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the catch decline after 2004 before falling to nothing for 3 years. However catches resumed in 2010 and rose to an all time high netting over 1250kg. This was a massive increase, more than twice the previous best year.\nWho doesn’t like a good comeback story?\nThat does however raise the question, what fueled this massive jump. Did Frank do more trips(maybe by buying new boats?) or more efficient trips( perhaps with better gear or better fishing spots?\n\n\nCode\ntrips_per_year &lt;- LandingData |&gt; \n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\"), trip_id) |&gt;\n  summarise(num_trips = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = num_trips))+\n  geom_col(fill = \"#248a9c\")+\n  labs(title = \"More Trips, But Not Enough to Explain Record Year\", \n       subtitle = \"Growth in trips partially explains 2014's record performance\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of fishing Trips\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ntrips_per_year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that there was some real growth in trips, but not enough to fuel that massive jump in catch. So I’ll test the second theory, that the trips themselves got more efficient.\n\n\nCode\nTrip.Efficiency &lt;- LandingData |&gt; \n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\"), trip_id) |&gt;\n  summarise(total.catch = sum(weight_kg, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  summarise(annual.mean.catch = mean(total.catch, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = annual.mean.catch))+\n  geom_col(fill = \"#248a9c\") +\n  labs(title = \"Frank's Fisheries has Rapidly Improved Efficiency since restarting in 2010\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Average catch per Trip (kg)\",\n       subtitle = \"Improvements in efficiency produced record catches in 2014\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\nTrip.Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere we go. There’s a massive jump in efficiency especially, culminating in that rock-star year of 2014. It is a combination of more trips and that efficiency responsible for the amazing performance of 2014.\nThere’s a couple things that could have contributed to that efficiency; better tools, better staff, better fishing grounds. Some of this we don’t have the information to investiagte, but we can absolutely look into which equipment is the most efficient. That catch per unit effort we use to standardise effort between equipment is a great metric to look at.\n\n\nCode\ngear.comparison &lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(gear_type) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_catch = mean(CPUE)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type, avg_catch), \n             y = avg_catch, colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_point(size = 5, \n             stroke = 2, \n             shape = 21, \n             aes(colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,\n                   y = 0, yend = avg_catch))+\n  labs(title = \"Gillnets and Spearfishing are the Most Efficient Gear\", \n       x = \"Gear Types\", y = \"Average Catch per Unit Effort\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), \n        legend.position = \"none\")+\n  coord_flip()\ngear.comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gillnet and speargun are the most efficient fishing gear used by Frank’s Fisheries. But that does not tell us their actual catch. We can see the total amount caught with each method.\n\n\nCode\ntotal.catch.per.method&lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(gear_type) |&gt; \n  summarise(total.catch = sum(weight_kg, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type,  total.catch),\n             y = total.catch, colour = gear_type))+\n # geom_col()+\n  geom_point(size = 5, \n             stroke = 2, \n             shape = 21, \n             aes(colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,\n                   y = 0, yend = total.catch))+\n  labs(title = \"Spearfishing brought in the majority of fish caught\",\n       x = \"Gear Type\", y = \"Total Catch (kg)\")+\n    coord_flip()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), \n        legend.position = \"none\")\ntotal.catch.per.method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speargun was the gear with the highest actual catch. This is not super surprising considering we know its one of the most efficient fishing gear. What is more surprising is that the gillnet had such a low catch.\nLet’s check on a reason why.\n\n\nCode\ngear.usage&lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(gear_type) |&gt; \n  summarise(num.uses = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type,num.uses), y = num.uses, \n             colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_point(size = 5, \n             stroke = 2, \n             shape = 21, \n             aes(colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,\n                   y = 0, yend = num.uses))+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title = \"Spearfishing proved the most popular method of fishing\", \n       x = \"Type of Gear used\", y = \"Number of Uses\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ngear.usage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s see how much the gear was used each year.\n\n\nCode\ngear.used&lt;-LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\"), gear_type) |&gt;\n  summarise(c = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = c, fill = gear_type))+\n  geom_col()+\n  labs(title = \"Change in Gear Usage over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of uses\", fill = \"Gear Type\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ngear.used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we can see, while there was no spearfishing before the shut down, it was a popular fishing method after, and by using the most efficient fishing method, and increasing the number of trips, Frank’s Fisheries had a record breaking year in 2014.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this little analysis. We went into the data, and managed to extract an actual story and gain some understanding from what was otherwise just a couple thousand rows of letters and numbers.\nThis information could be useful to present to the owners of Frank’s Fisheries to explain their success in 2014. It could be important for competitors who want to keep up. It could be important for fisheries regulators who want to understand 2014 and see if it’s sustainable.\nThere’s a lot of practical use in uncovering what the data was saying in a situation like this. I’d love to take on another dataset like this and see what I find next time. Until then.\nWalk Good."

That catch per unit effort we use to standardise effort between equipment is a great metric to look at.\n\n\nCode\ngear.comparison &lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(gear_type) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_catch = mean(CPUE)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type, avg_catch), \n             y = avg_catch, colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_point(size = 5, \n             stroke = 2, \n             shape = 21, \n             aes(colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,\n                   y = 0, yend = avg_catch))+\n  labs(title = \"Gillnets and Spearfishing are the Most Efficient Gear\", \n       x = \"Gear Types\", y = \"Average Catch per Unit Effort\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), \n        legend.position = \"none\")+\n  coord_flip()\ngear.comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gillnet and speargun are the most efficient fishing gear used by Frank’s Fisheries. But that does not tell us their actual catch. We can see the total amount caught with each method.\n\n\nCode\ntotal.catch.per.method&lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(gear_type) |&gt; \n  summarise(total.catch = sum(weight_kg, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type,  total.catch),\n             y = total.catch, colour = gear_type))+\n # geom_col()+\n  geom_point(size = 5, \n             stroke = 2, \n             shape = 21, \n             aes(colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,\n                   y = 0, yend = total.catch))+\n  labs(title = \"Spearfishing brought in the majority of fish caught\",\n       x = \"Gear Type\", y = \"Total Catch (kg)\")+\n    coord_flip()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), \n        legend.position = \"none\")\ntotal.catch.per.method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speargun was the gear with the highest actual catch. This is not super surprising considering we know its one of the most efficient fishing gear. What is more surprising is that the gillnet had such a low catch.\nLet’s check on a reason why.\n\n\nCode\ngear.usage&lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(gear_type) |&gt; \n  summarise(num.uses = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type,num.uses), y = num.uses, \n             colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_point(size = 5, \n             stroke = 2, \n             shape = 21, \n             aes(colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,\n                   y = 0, yend = num.uses))+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title = \"Spearfishing proved the most popular method of fishing\", \n       x = \"Type of Gear used\", y = \"Number of Uses\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ngear.usage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s see how much the gear was used each year.\n\n\nCode\ngear.used&lt;-LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\"), gear_type) |&gt;\n  summarise(c = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = c, fill = gear_type))+\n  geom_col()+\n  labs(title = \"Change in Gear Usage over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of uses\", fill = \"Gear Type\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ngear.used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we can see, while there was no spearfishing before the shut down, it was a popular fishing method after, and by using the most efficient fishing method, and increasing the number of trips, Frank’s Fisheries had a record breaking year in 2014."

It could be important for competitors who want to keep up. It could be important for fisheries regulators who want to understand 2014 and see if it’s sustainable.\nThere’s a lot of practical use in uncovering what the data was saying in a situation like this.

    "text": "When I talk about being a marine biologist one common question I get is if I scuba dive.\nIn short, the answer is yes.\nOf course, that opens the door to a whole lot of questions, questions I love to answer, because I love diving. This post is to answer some of the frequent questions I get, and demystify scuba diving a little bit in the process. I hope you’ll leave with better knowledge of scuba, get a feel for why I love it, and maybe want to try it yourself.\n\n\nOur lovely planet ’s surface is about 70% covered by water. There is more water covering the Earth than land. Which means a lot of the wonderful natural world that I (and people like me) want to see is underwater. At our best, us humans can only dive for a few minutes. I will humbly and honestly admit I am not among those best. (Although I would love to do more freediving in the future.)\nSo, that means those of us who want stay down there for longer than a few minutes need special gear and special training. This is where scuba comes in. Scuba is technically an acronym (self contained underwater breathing apparatus). In practice, Scuba is gear that lets you carry gas underwater, and breathe it to stay underwater for longer.\n\n\n\nWith the right gear and training, spending an hour under water isn’t too hard\n\n\nOf course, to use this equipment, you need some special training. Some is theory, to help you understand your gear, and what happens to your body as you dive. The rest is practical. For many, this is where they take their first breath underwater and get addicted forever.\nThere’s a number of organisations that can teach and certify you to dive. Some are PADI, SSI and NAUI, but rest assured there are several more.\n\n\n\nI’m addicted. That’s the long and short of it. I love diving. Sure, I’ve had to (and will have to) dive for work. But even if work no longer required it , I would still dive. Here’s a very short list of the top 3 reasons I dive:\n1. It’s beautiful and calming\n2. It’s a Social Activity\n3. There’s always something new to see.\nThe underwater world is absolutely stunning. It’s so unlike what we see at the surface some people say it feels like a whole other world. And yet most of our world is underwater like this.\nOn top of that, diving has the unique position of being a social activity where there’s no speaking (some of my favourite people I met last year, I met diving. ) There’s plenty of communicating and speaking above the water, but once you descend, you enjoy the underwater world with your buddies without words.\n\n\n\nMe and some of the wonderful new friends I made diving\n\n\nAnd even having dived the same sites multiple times, there’s always some new wildlife, some new change, something new to notice. Every dive, in its own way, is an adventure into a world most people will never be able to see unless they become divers too.\n\n\n\nYou find an instructor and learn to dive.There are quite a few organisations as I listed above, but they are all “roughly” the same. If your instructor is good, your training will be good, no matter the organisation.\n\n\n\nYou can learn to dive with an instructor from any of these organisations\n\n\nIt’s obviously a paid course, and not necessarily a cheap one. On top of that, to my great pain, dive gear is expensive. But you need not buy it all at once doing your course. There’s benefits to having your own gear, namely building up familiarity with it. But a lot of gear works the same, and a lot of places where most people dive will carry rental gear. You don’t need to buy a full set to start.\nIf you ask me, you are probably good with no more than a good mask and fins. (and that’s mostly for hygiene and comfort reasons. You don’t need any gear to start.\nThen, do your course. It’s not difficult and doesn’t need to take more than a week. There’s a theory component where you learn about your gear, and how your body responds to going underwater. Then there’s a set of confined water dives in some calm sheltered water(a pool is often, but not always used here), Then a couple open water dives and you’re clear to go.\n\n\n\nMe and some of the divers I got certified with\n\n\nThen comes the final and most important part. Dive often, make diver friends and enjoy the ocean and ocean lovers together.\nThere’s lots of diving for lots of people. So be safe, but try new things to see what you like best. One of my favourite dive activities is identifying marine life, but I know people who live for wrecks or spearing lionfish on their dives.\n\n\n\nAs for me, I’m currently a PADI Advanced Open Water Diver. That’s my current highest level of certification, but its not where I intend to stop. After some more diving, and building more experience, I plan to level up and advance my certification to Rescue Diver. I’m considering stopping there for a while. After that, the only certification I’d be in a rush to get is my Nitrox certification.\nRescue diver training helps build up independence in the water, and the ability to better deal with problems as the occur on and under the water. Nitrox teaches a diver how to (safely) use different gas mixtures to change the depth and time they can dive to.\nBut I have a ton more diving dreams. One of my big ones is to go on a liveaboard, which is essentially a dive cruise. A special boat, one part dive boat-one part hotel, travels around to some great divespots with a team of likeminded divers. It’s been a big dream of mine to go on one ever since I found out they existed.\n\n\n\nLikeminded divers make every dive better\n\n\nAnother is more dive vacations. I’ve only dived in Jamaica so far, but I want to do the rest of the Caribbean and worldwide in the tropics eventually. Whether or not I go anywhere colder remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nWreck Dives like this have been fun so far, I can’t wait to do more\n\n\nFinally, I want to see (and photograph), more marine life. Manta’s are the one animal I’m most looking forward to, but in truth I just want to see more, and experience more under water.\n\n\n\nSo, now you know a little bit more about why I dive, how to get started, and the dreams I have for my diving future. Diving is definitely one of my favourite parts of being a marine biologists, and one of my favourite activities in general. I’m glad to be able to share the word and hopefully inspire a new diver or two. I’d love to dive with you someday too.\nIf you’re in Jamaica, many resorts offer some quick training and certification. I also strongly recommend Yardie Diver’s who offer good training, and excursions where you can try scuba diving to see if its right for you. You can also try out Lady G’Diver in Portland. These dives shops are also great places to meet divers, and get diving done after you’re certified.\nWalk good and happy diving."

    "text": "The Goals\nAt Kee Farms, to put it simply, we grow marine products like seaweed. However, we are still in the learning process. Our first batch of seaweed was depleted. So we needed a new starting crop to start growing. This meant taking a team out into the wild to find and gather some wild seaweed. Ideally, we wanted the same species of seaweed we had been growing before. Right now, we are focusing on a red seaweed known as Gracilaria . Gracilaria is a useful and popular red seaweed. Different species of Gracilaria are grown in other parts of the world. Here in Jamaica, we call it “irish moss” and traditionally for it, but our company is among the first to farm it. Here you can see some of the Gracilaria from our first round of collection dives. This specific species is called Gracilaria domingensis.\n\n\n\nSome of the Irish Moss in hand\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Irish Moss from our first trip to White Horses"

    "section": "The Start",
    "text": "The Start\nI’ll be honest. I had mixed feelings about this trip to start. Our first batch of seaweed came from a site named White Horses in St. Thomas. Its called that because the waves crashing look like..well..white horses. In other words, the water gets pretty rough. The roads to and from that site are pretty rough in their own right. The first trip was pretty rough in its own right. The second trip to White Horses was even worse. That time, the other divers and I had gotten into a mess. We collected no seaweed and almost got ourselves seriously hurt. It was a textbook case of horrible conditions. Visibility was less than three feet, surge was rough and the current pushed us towards rocks with some serious force.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as the leader for the last dive, my team and I made sure we analyzed our loss(after a beer) ad figured out what we could do better. One of the major steps was to reach our dive site early, before the water picked up for the day. We had tried to reach early on the previous trip, but due to circumstances, we didn’t reach until 1pm, when the sea was already rough.\nSo this time, we left out at 4:30 am. So after a wonderful 4 hours of sleep, we got driving. A contact had advised us of a new dive site. The drive was long, but they had done some paving on the roads. It wasn’t great, but I could see the improvement. We got to see some nice views on the ride down. Jamaica, especially the parish of Portland, is a beautiful place. Especially if you’re like me and love the sea and sea views.\n\n\n\nSunrise in Portland Jamaica\n\n\nWe kept driving and arrived around 8am. And then after stretching our legs, we got to work."

The sediment was muddy, and visibility was basically nothing(and yet somehow still better than white horses.) We could feel down and pull up the seaweed. It was another Gracilaria species, but we were more than happy to take it. We didn’t need our Scuba gear, so we set it to float at the surface. It helped keep our collection bags off the bottom as well. Then we went gathering up the irish moss. We talked and joked about crocs coming for us while we harvested. It had one of the divers so wound up she jumped at a fish, thinking it was a croc. Eventually the team, after a little more than an hour and a half, made our way back into shore.\nWe talked to some locals who told us how there was plenty of another kind of irish moss nearby and showed us the site. We loaded up our truck, and got moving.\n\n\n\nMe at the Bowden Bay, ready to gather some seaweed"

We went to check on our oyster crops. We had been drying the little guys to clean off any other sea creatures growing on them. And finally we got out of the water.\nWe tried to rinse our scuba gear, as you always should. Only to find there was no freshwater. So someone working at our partners in the bay, took us to a little roadside waterfall to rinse off…which was also dry. He said he had one more option, and took us through a VERY out of the way path, to a stream where we could rinse our gear and ourselves. We had a little swim and rinse off, and started the drive home.\nAll credit for photos goes out to my team members who took them. In particular I’d love to big up Britney Williams."

    "text": "Just what affects my Salary?\nI’d like to frame this post a little differently. As much as I like making pretty charts, the benefit of this data is really being able to make better decisions. While it may not predict the future exactly; more knowledge, especially more useful knowledge, helps us make better choices. More effective choices are what help us meet our goals, no matter who we are.\nSo I’ll put myself in the position of someone else, and invite you to join with me. Firstly, I’d like to think of myself as a young professional interested in this company. I want to know what matters to get my salary as high as it can be.\nClearly other things matter. For example, job satisfaction is important. Exactly how much money you are willing to trade off for job satisfaction is a personal choice. In this case, I’ll assume our imaginary professional only cares about their salary for now.\nI know from above that the salary is linked pretty heavily to projects completed, so, I’ll look into that. Right away you see the benefit of exploring the data, I know where to look, and don’t have to search for every possible connection since I have general direction.\n\n\nCode\nsalary.age.plot&lt;-ggplot(Dataset, mapping = aes(x = Projects.Completed, y = round(Salary), colour = Department))+\n  geom_point(alpha= 0.8, size = 1.2)+\n  labs(title =\"Plot of Salary and Projects completed at a certain company\")+\n  xlab(\"# Projects Completed out of 25\")+\n  ylab(\"Salary\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format())+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = FALSE))\nsalary.age.plot&lt;-ggplotly(salary.age.plot)\nsalary.age.plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright. There’s a pretty good figure. You can clearly “see” the line running down the middle of those points and there’s a definite relationship. As an employee here, completing projects definitely helps improve my salary. So I can take steps there to get my salary up here.\nBut that’s not the only question I can ask. Lets say (for arguments sake) I’m a woman. I want to know if at this company, I’m likely to make less than a man working here, on average.\n\n\nCode\nGender.Wage.Boxplot&lt;- Dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Gender, y = Salary, fill = Gender))+\n  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format())+\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot showing salaries in a certain company by gender\")+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\nGender.Wage.Boxplot&lt;-ggplotly(Gender.Wage.Boxplot)\nGender.Wage.Boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (Please note that when I say average in this context, I mean median. Medians are less distorted by huge outliers at the top or bottom. Still, Things hide in averages, I’ll go just a little deeper. After all, this is our salary I’m talking about.)\n\n\nCode\ngender.hist&lt;-ggplot(Dataset, mapping = aes(x = Salary, fill = Gender))+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format())+\n  ggtitle(\"Salary Distribution by Gender\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank())\nprint(gender.hist)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell then. Now I can see that the average woman makes more than the average man in this company, especially around that $100 000 range. The men seem to have higher outliers, or a few at the top making way more money, but they do make less on average. At any rate, being a woman doesn’t hurt my salary prospects on average.\nFinally, If I want to make more money, what department should I focus on? In practice, it depends on my skillset, job openings and all that, but for this exercise, let’s see what can help me maximize my salary,\n\n\nCode\nDepartment.Wage.Boxplot&lt;- Dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Department, y = Salary, fill = Department))+\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8, notch = TRUE)+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format())+\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot showing salaries in a certain company by department\")+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\nDepartment.Wage.Boxplot&lt;-ggplotly(Department.Wage.Boxplot)\nDepartment.Wage.Boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes it easy to see. The I.T department has the highest average salary. Finance also has a pretty good average salary, and the highest “floor” or low end salary in the company. Now, as a prospective applicant, I would know where to focus. Finance and IT are pretty close though. At this point, the choice might well come down to job satisfaction(even though I said we didn’t care).\n\n\nCode\nDepartment.Satisfaction&lt;-Dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Department, y = (Satisfaction.Rate..../100), fill = Department))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  labs(title = \"Job Satisfaction by Department\")+\n  ylab(\"Satisfaction Rate (%)\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format())+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\nDepartment.Satisfaction&lt;-ggplotly(Department.Satisfaction)\nDepartment.Satisfaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat might make the difference for I.T as our professional. A little extra job satisfaction for what’s basically the same pay.\nOn the other hand, If i was an employer/manager, This info would help with hiring. I’d know who to pay attention to, and which staff are most important to retain. I’d also know which departments on my team are the least and most satisfied. It might even explain things like employee turnover I might be dealing with."

We can’t know the future, but this puts us in a position to make more educated choices.\nI have a couple hopes for myself, data analysis wise. I’m largely self taught. I intend to keep growing and improving. I want to get good enough that it represents a potential income source. But I also want to cultivate that way of thinking. I want to grow and sharpen the mindset that sees connections, asks questions and uses data to find answers. I think my science background gives me a little start there, but its definitely something I plan to keep improving.\nFor my next few data analysis posts, I’ve been considering data analysis on marine biology data sets. Its a good mix of my interests, and I’d love to look into that niche specifically.\nUntil next time, Walk Good."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Just a brief disclaimer: This article was originally published in August 2023 on my LinkedIn. I’ve copied it over and made a few edits to drop it on my blog.\nDuring my Internship at the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, I had the honour and opportunity to pursue a research project of my own, provided I kept up with my internship responsibilities. I chose to undertake a personal project, and chose one near and dear to my heart, Seaweed Cultivation.\nSeaweed aquaculture and mariculture are topics I believe hold a lot of promise for Jamaica and the wider Caribbean. Jamaica already uses seaweeds, collectively termed “irish moss” in a number of traditional foods and beverages. To date however, the seaweeds used have all been wild harvested. This runs the risk of depleting natural stock.\nCultivating these seaweeds would give more control, help produce more consistent supply, and provide income to coastal communities. There are also several other value-added products which can be created from seaweeds. If it catches on, seaweed farming can also help remove excess nutrients from the water and help ease pressure on the local marine environment. Other territories, namely in East Africa and Asia do cultivate seaweeds, but the practice is not established in Jamaica.\nI had been interested in the topic before, and took this opportunity to explore it. My supervisor and I identified the species of Irish Moss available as Euchuema cotonii. Over the course of my internship. I reviewed existing literature, built out a simple cultivation apparatus, seeded it with Irish Moss and tended it.\n\n\n\nMe with my DIY cultivation apparatus\n\n\nThis tending usually took the form of cleaning. Every Wednesday, I would go shake the silt and sand off my seaweed. Then I would weigh it and record the data. Normally, if I was in the water, which was often, I’d check and clean the seaweed then too.\n\n\n\nWeighing the seaweed to monitor growth\n\n\nAs a scientist, I believe in using data, quantifying results and making data driven decisions as much as possible. I recorded the growth, health and appearance of my seaweed crop. I analysed and visualised the results using R. I learned a lot being in the water tending to my seaweed. And as a reward, I got to be (as far as I’m aware) one of if not the first seaweed farmers of the 21st century in Jamaica.\n\n\n\nMe with the seaweed the day I planted it out on April 14, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my friend Andrew lifting my seaweed on May 31, 2023\n\n\nFrom this you can easily see the crazy growth my crop managed to achieve. Eucheuma is cultivated around the world and known for its rapid growth, commnly said to triple in size in 6 weeks. My Eucheuma managed to match these figures. There’s a lot more detailed analysis that went into the report, but to put it simply:\nThe data and growth I recorded was more than encouraging, The possibility of cultivating seaweed in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean seems bright and hopeful. I personally intend to continue working at it, and establishing mariculture in Jamaica."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When I talk about being a marine biologist one common question I get is if I scuba dive.\nIn short, the answer is yes.\nOf course, that opens the door to a whole lot of questions, questions I love to answer, because I love diving. This post is to answer some of the frequent questions I get, and demystify scuba diving a little bit in the process. I hope you’ll leave with better knowledge of scuba, get a feel for why I love it, and maybe want to try it yourself.\n\n\nOur lovely planet ’s surface is about 70% covered by water. There is more water covering the Earth than land. Which means a lot of the wonderful natural world that I (and people like me) want to see is underwater. At our best, us humans can only dive for a few minutes. I will humbly and honestly admit I am not among those best. (Although I would love to do more freediving in the future.)\nSo, that means those of us who want stay down there for longer than a few minutes need special gear and special training. This is where scuba comes in. Scuba is technically an acronym (self contained underwater breathing apparatus). In practice, Scuba is gear that lets you carry gas underwater, and breathe it to stay underwater for longer.\n\n\n\nWith the right gear and training, spending an hour under water isn’t too hard\n\n\nOf course, to use this equipment, you need some special training. Some is theory, to help you understand your gear, and what happens to your body as you dive. The rest is practical. For many, this is where they take their first breath underwater and get addicted forever.\nThere’s a number of organisations that can teach and certify you to dive. Some are PADI, SSI and NAUI, but rest assured there are several more.\n\n\n\nI’m addicted. That’s the long and short of it. I love diving. Sure, I’ve had to (and will have to) dive for work. But even if work no longer required it , I would still dive. Here’s a very short list of the top 3 reasons I dive:\n1. It’s beautiful and calming\n2. It’s a Social Activity\n3. There’s always something new to see.\nThe underwater world is absolutely stunning. It’s so unlike what we see at the surface some people say it feels like a whole other world. And yet most of our world is underwater like this.\nOn top of that, diving has the unique position of being a social activity where there’s no speaking (some of my favourite people I met last year, I met diving. ) There’s plenty of communicating and speaking above the water, but once you descend, you enjoy the underwater world with your buddies without words.\n\n\n\nMe and some of the wonderful new friends I made diving\n\n\nAnd even having dived the same sites multiple times, there’s always some new wildlife, some new change, something new to notice. Every dive, in its own way, is an adventure into a world most people will never be able to see unless they become divers too.\n\n\n\nYou find an instructor and learn to dive.There are quite a few organisations as I listed above, but they are all “roughly” the same. If your instructor is good, your training will be good, no matter the organisation.\n\n\n\nYou can learn to dive with an instructor from any of these organisations\n\n\nIt’s obviously a paid course, and not necessarily a cheap one. On top of that, to my great pain, dive gear is expensive. But you need not buy it all at once doing your course. There’s benefits to having your own gear, namely building up familiarity with it. But a lot of gear works the same, and a lot of places where most people dive will carry rental gear. You don’t need to buy a full set to start.\nIf you ask me, you are probably good with no more than a good mask and fins. (and that’s mostly for hygiene and comfort reasons. You don’t need any gear to start.\nThen, do your course. It’s not difficult and doesn’t need to take more than a week. There’s a theory component where you learn about your gear, and how your body responds to going underwater. Then there’s a set of confined water dives in some calm sheltered water(a pool is often, but not always used here), Then a couple open water dives and you’re clear to go.\n\n\n\nMe and some of the divers I got certified with\n\n\nThen comes the final and most important part. Dive often, make diver friends and enjoy the ocean and ocean lovers together.\nThere’s lots of diving for lots of people. So be safe, but try new things to see what you like best. One of my favourite dive activities is identifying marine life, but I know people who live for wrecks or spearing lionfish on their dives.\n\n\n\nAs for me, I’m currently a PADI Advanced Open Water Diver. That’s my current highest level of certification, but its not where I intend to stop. After some more diving, and building more experience, I plan to level up and advance my certification to Rescue Diver. I’m considering stopping there for a while. After that, the only certification I’d be in a rush to get is my Nitrox certification.\nRescue diver training helps build up independence in the water, and the ability to better deal with problems as the occur on and under the water. Nitrox teaches a diver how to (safely) use different gas mixtures to change the depth and time they can dive to.\nBut I have a ton more diving dreams. One of my big ones is to go on a liveaboard, which is essentially a dive cruise. A special boat, one part dive boat-one part hotel, travels around to some great divespots with a team of likeminded divers. It’s been a big dream of mine to go on one ever since I found out they existed.\n\n\n\nLikeminded divers make every dive better\n\n\nAnother is more dive vacations. I’ve only dived in Jamaica so far, but I want to do the rest of the Caribbean and worldwide in the tropics eventually. Whether or not I go anywhere colder remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nWreck Dives like this have been fun so far, I can’t wait to do more\n\n\nFinally, I want to see (and photograph), more marine life. Manta’s are the one animal I’m most looking forward to, but in truth I just want to see more, and experience more under water.\n\n\n\nSo, now you know a little bit more about why I dive, how to get started, and the dreams I have for my diving future. Diving is definitely one of my favourite parts of being a marine biologists, and one of my favourite activities in general. I’m glad to be able to share the word and hopefully inspire a new diver or two. I’d love to dive with you someday too.\nIf you’re in Jamaica, many resorts offer some quick training and certification. I also strongly recommend Yardie Diver’s who offer good training, and excursions where you can try scuba diving to see if its right for you. You can also try out Lady G’Diver in Portland. These dives shops are also great places to meet divers, and get diving done after you’re certified.\nWalk good and happy diving."

In practice, Scuba is gear that lets you carry gas underwater, and breathe it to stay underwater for longer.\n\n\n\nWith the right gear and training, spending an hour under water isn’t too hard\n\n\nOf course, to use this equipment, you need some special training. Some is theory, to help you understand your gear, and what happens to your body as you dive. The rest is practical. For many, this is where they take their first breath underwater and get addicted forever.\nThere’s a number of organisations that can teach and certify you to dive. Some are PADI, SSI and NAUI, but rest assured there are several more."

    "text": "I’m addicted. That’s the long and short of it. I love diving. Sure, I’ve had to (and will have to) dive for work. But even if work no longer required it , I would still dive. Here’s a very short list of the top 3 reasons I dive:\n1. It’s beautiful and calming\n2. It’s a Social Activity\n3. There’s always something new to see.\nThe underwater world is absolutely stunning. It’s so unlike what we see at the surface some people say it feels like a whole other world. And yet most of our world is underwater like this.\nOn top of that, diving has the unique position of being a social activity where there’s no speaking (some of my favourite people I met last year, I met diving. ) There’s plenty of communicating and speaking above the water, but once you descend, you enjoy the underwater world with your buddies without words.\n\n\n\nMe and some of the wonderful new friends I made diving\n\n\nAnd even having dived the same sites multiple times, there’s always some new wildlife, some new change, something new to notice. Every dive, in its own way, is an adventure into a world most people will never be able to see unless they become divers too."

    "text": "You find an instructor and learn to dive.There are quite a few organisations as I listed above, but they are all “roughly” the same. If your instructor is good, your training will be good, no matter the organisation.\n\n\n\nYou can learn to dive with an instructor from any of these organisations\n\n\nIt’s obviously a paid course, and not necessarily a cheap one. On top of that, to my great pain, dive gear is expensive. But you need not buy it all at once doing your course. There’s benefits to having your own gear, namely building up familiarity with it. But a lot of gear works the same, and a lot of places where most people dive will carry rental gear. You don’t need to buy a full set to start.\nIf you ask me, you are probably good with no more than a good mask and fins. (and that’s mostly for hygiene and comfort reasons. You don’t need any gear to start.\nThen, do your course. It’s not difficult and doesn’t need to take more than a week. There’s a theory component where you learn about your gear, and how your body responds to going underwater. Then there’s a set of confined water dives in some calm sheltered water(a pool is often, but not always used here), Then a couple open water dives and you’re clear to go.\n\n\n\nMe and some of the divers I got certified with\n\n\nThen comes the final and most important part. Dive often, make diver friends and enjoy the ocean and ocean lovers together.\nThere’s lots of diving for lots of people. So be safe, but try new things to see what you like best. One of my favourite dive activities is identifying marine life, but I know people who live for wrecks or spearing lionfish on their dives."

    "text": "As for me, I’m currently a PADI Advanced Open Water Diver. That’s my current highest level of certification, but its not where I intend to stop. After some more diving, and building more experience, I plan to level up and advance my certification to Rescue Diver. I’m considering stopping there for a while. After that, the only certification I’d be in a rush to get is my Nitrox certification.\nRescue diver training helps build up independence in the water, and the ability to better deal with problems as the occur on and under the water. Nitrox teaches a diver how to (safely) use different gas mixtures to change the depth and time they can dive to.\nBut I have a ton more diving dreams. One of my big ones is to go on a liveaboard, which is essentially a dive cruise. A special boat, one part dive boat-one part hotel, travels around to some great divespots with a team of likeminded divers. It’s been a big dream of mine to go on one ever since I found out they existed.\n\n\n\nLikeminded divers make every dive better\n\n\nAnother is more dive vacations. I’ve only dived in Jamaica so far, but I want to do the rest of the Caribbean and worldwide in the tropics eventually. Whether or not I go anywhere colder remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nWreck Dives like this have been fun so far, I can’t wait to do more\n\n\nFinally, I want to see (and photograph), more marine life. Manta’s are the one animal I’m most looking forward to, but in truth I just want to see more, and experience more under water."

    "text": "So, now you know a little bit more about why I dive, how to get started, and the dreams I have for my diving future. Diving is definitely one of my favourite parts of being a marine biologists, and one of my favourite activities in general. I’m glad to be able to share the word and hopefully inspire a new diver or two. I’d love to dive with you someday too.\nIf you’re in Jamaica, many resorts offer some quick training and certification. I also strongly recommend Yardie Diver’s who offer good training, and excursions where you can try scuba diving to see if its right for you. You can also try out Lady G’Diver in Portland. These dives shops are also great places to meet divers, and get diving done after you’re certified.\nWalk good and happy diving."

This one is based on domain knowledge. I did some quick conversion of the catches into kilograms, and calculated “Catch per unit effort”, a measure used to standardize catch across gear types.\n\n\nCode\nLandingData &lt;- LandingData |&gt; \n  mutate(weight_kg = weight_g/1000) |&gt;\n  mutate(CPUE = weight_kg/effort)\n\n\nAnd that’s it. Now let’s get into the bit that’s exciting.\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look then. Firstly, I will look at how much Frank’s Fisheries caught each year. Then I get to begin turning data into a story.\n\n\nCode\ntotal.landings&lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\")) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_catch = sum(weight_kg)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = total_catch)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#248a9c\")+\n  #geom_point(size = 1.8, alpha = 0.8, colour = \"#248a9c\")+\n  #geom_line(colour = \"#248a9c\")+\n  labs(title = \"Frank's Fisheries Shows Record Breaking Catches in 2014\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Total Catch(kg)\",\n       caption = \"After a decline and 3 years downtime ending in 2009, landings have grown to an all time high in 2014\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n#total.landings&lt;-ggplotly(total.landings)\ntotal.landings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the catch decline after 2004 before falling to nothing for 3 years. However catches resumed in 2010 and rose to an all time high netting over 1250kg. This was a massive increase, more than twice the previous best year.\nWho doesn’t like a good comeback story?\nThat does however raise the question, what fueled this massive jump. Did Frank do more trips(maybe by buying new boats?) or more efficient trips( perhaps with better gear or better fishing spots?\n\n\nCode\ntrips_per_year &lt;- LandingData |&gt; \n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\"), trip_id) |&gt;\n  summarise(num_trips = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = num_trips))+\n  geom_col(fill = \"#248a9c\")+\n  labs(title = \"More Trips, But Not Enough to Explain Record Year\", \n       subtitle = \"Growth in trips partially explains 2014's record performance\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of fishing Trips\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ntrips_per_year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that there was some real growth in trips, but not enough to fuel that massive jump in catch. So I’ll test the second theory, that the trips themselves got more efficient.\n\n\nCode\nTrip.Efficiency &lt;- LandingData |&gt; \n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\"), trip_id) |&gt;\n  summarise(total.catch = sum(weight_kg, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  summarise(annual.mean.catch = mean(total.catch, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = annual.mean.catch))+\n  geom_col(fill = \"#248a9c\") +\n  labs(title = \"Frank's Fisheries has Rapidly Improved Efficiency since restarting in 2010\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Average catch per Trip (kg)\",\n       subtitle = \"Improvements in efficiency produced record catches in 2014\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\nTrip.Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere we go. There’s a massive jump in efficiency especially, culminating in that rock-star year of 2014. It is a combination of more trips and that efficiency responsible for the amazing performance of 2014.\nThere’s a couple things that could have contributed to that efficiency; better tools, better staff, better fishing grounds. Some of this we don’t have the information to investiagte, but we can absolutely look into which equipment is the most efficient.

But that does not tell us their actual catch. We can see the total amount caught with each method.\n\n\nCode\ntotal.catch.per.method&lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(gear_type) |&gt; \n  summarise(total.catch = sum(weight_kg, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type,  total.catch),\n             y = total.catch, colour = gear_type))+\n # geom_col()+\n  geom_point(size = 5, \n             stroke = 2, \n             shape = 21, \n             aes(colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,\n                   y = 0, yend = total.catch))+\n  labs(title = \"Spearfishing brought in the majority of fish caught\",\n       x = \"Gear Type\", y = \"Total Catch (kg)\")+\n    coord_flip()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), \n        legend.position = \"none\")\ntotal.catch.per.method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speargun was the gear with the highest actual catch. This is not super surprising considering we know its one of the most efficient fishing gear. What is more surprising is that the gillnet had such a low catch.\nLet’s check on a reason why.\n\n\nCode\ngear.usage&lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(gear_type) |&gt; \n  summarise(num.uses = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type,num.uses), y = num.uses, \n             colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_point(size = 5, \n             stroke = 2, \n             shape = 21, \n             aes(colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,\n                   y = 0, yend = num.uses))+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title = \"Spearfishing proved the most popular method of fishing\", \n       x = \"Type of Gear used\", y = \"Number of Uses\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ngear.usage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s see how much the gear was used each year.\n\n\nCode\ngear.used&lt;-LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\"), gear_type) |&gt;\n  summarise(c = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = c, fill = gear_type))+\n  geom_col()+\n  labs(title = \"Change in Gear Usage over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of uses\", fill = \"Gear Type\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ngear.used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we can see, while there was no spearfishing before the shut down, it was a popular fishing method after, and by using the most efficient fishing method, and increasing the number of trips, Frank’s Fisheries had a record breaking year in 2014.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this little analysis. We went into the data, and managed to extract an actual story and gain some understanding from what was otherwise just a couple thousand rows of letters and numbers.\nThis information could be useful to present to the owners of Frank’s Fisheries to explain their success in 2014. It could be important for competitors who want to keep up. It could be important for fisheries regulators who want to understand 2014 and see if it’s sustainable.\nThere’s a lot of practical use in uncovering what the data was saying in a situation like this. I’d love to take on another dataset like this and see what I find next time. Until then.\nWalk Good."

However catches resumed in 2010 and rose to an all time high netting over 1250kg. This was a massive increase, more than twice the previous best year.\nWho doesn’t like a good comeback story?\nThat does however raise the question, what fueled this massive jump. Did Frank do more trips(maybe by buying new boats?) or more efficient trips( perhaps with better gear or better fishing spots?\n\n\nCode\ntrips_per_year &lt;- LandingData |&gt; \n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\"), trip_id) |&gt;\n  summarise(num_trips = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = num_trips))+\n  geom_col(fill = \"#248a9c\")+\n  labs(title = \"More Trips, But Not Enough to Explain Record Year\", \n       subtitle = \"Growth in trips partially explains 2014's record performance\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of fishing Trips\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ntrips_per_year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that there was some real growth in trips, but not enough to fuel that massive jump in catch.

There’s a massive jump in efficiency especially, culminating in that rock-star year of 2014. It is a combination of more trips and that efficiency responsible for the amazing performance of 2014.\nThere’s a couple things that could have contributed to that efficiency; better tools, better staff, better fishing grounds. Some of this we don’t have the information to investiagte, but we can absolutely look into which equipment is the most efficient.

What is more surprising is that the gillnet had such a low catch.\nLet’s check on a reason why.\n\n\nCode\ngear.usage&lt;- LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(gear_type) |&gt; \n  summarise(num.uses = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gear_type,num.uses), y = num.uses, \n             colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_point(size = 5, \n             stroke = 2, \n             shape = 21, \n             aes(colour = gear_type))+\n  geom_segment(aes(x = gear_type, xend = gear_type,\n                   y = 0, yend = num.uses))+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title = \"Spearfishing proved the most popular method of fishing\", \n       x = \"Type of Gear used\", y = \"Number of Uses\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ngear.usage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s see how much the gear was used each year.\n\n\nCode\ngear.used&lt;-LandingData |&gt;\n  group_by(year = floor_date(date, \"year\"), gear_type) |&gt;\n  summarise(c = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = c, fill = gear_type))+\n  geom_col()+\n  labs(title = \"Change in Gear Usage over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of uses\", fill = \"Gear Type\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ngear.used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we can see, while there was no spearfishing before the shut down, it was a popular fishing method after, and by using the most efficient fishing method, and increasing the number of trips, Frank’s Fisheries had a record breaking year in 2014."

    "text": "Why do divers even have logbooks?\nSome of you might be asking what even is a diver’s logbook, or why we keep them. Logbooks are where divers record logs of their dives. They are pretty common, and pretty much all divers are taught to keep them when we are getting trained(although some of us definitely fall off track.)\nLogbooks are meant for us diver’ to track our progress and improvement and remember our fun dives. We usually record things like:\n\nThe dive site\nThe depth(maximum depth, or average depth or both)\nThe time we were underwater\nThe conditions underwater(are the waves and currents strong? How far can you see?)\nThe amount of gas we use on the dive\n\nOther things we include might be any wildlife we saw, any equipment we used and personal notes or feelings about the dive.\nWe don’t all use physical logbooks, in 2023 there are a number of apps available. Still some people do still find it satisfying to log their dives on pen and paper…at least to a point.\n\n\n\nMy beat up Log Book has seen a couple dives, and will be seeing a couple more\n\n\nFirst lets prepare. As always, I’m using R for analysis. I’ll load the packages I need from R.\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata)\n\n\nLets read in the data, look around and see what this person recorded:\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\nDataset&lt;-read.csv(\"scuba_diving_logbook - cleaned_data.csv\")\nglimpse(Dataset)\n\n\nRows: 445\nColumns: 15\n$ id                &lt;chr&gt; \"2H\", \"3H\", \"4H\", \"5H\", \"6H\", \"7H\", \"8H\", \"9H\", \"10H…\n$ date              &lt;chr&gt; \"2005-01-16\", \"2005-05-01\", \"2005-05-22\", \"2005-07-1…\n$ category          &lt;chr&gt; \"Hobbies\", \"Hobbies\", \"Hobbies\", \"Hobbies\", \"Hobbies…\n$ country           &lt;chr&gt; \"France\", \"France\", \"France\", \"France\", \"France\", \"F…\n$ city              &lt;chr&gt; \"Marseille\", \"Marseille\", \"Cassis\", \"Marseille\", \"Ma…\n$ site              &lt;chr&gt; \"Les moyades\", \"La grotte mystérieuse\", \"Les pierres…\n$ gps_position_lat  &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ gps_position_long &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ maritime.location &lt;chr&gt; \"Mediterranean sea\", \"Mediterranean sea\", \"Mediterra…\n$ stand             &lt;chr&gt; \"Boat\", \"Boat\", \"Seaside\", \"Boat\", \"Boat\", \"Boat\", \"…\n$ type              &lt;chr&gt; \"Technical\", \"Exploration\", \"Technical\", \"Exploratio…\n$ circuit           &lt;chr&gt; \"Open circuit\", \"Open circuit\", \"Open circuit\", \"Ope…\n$ gas               &lt;chr&gt; \"AIr\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Air\", \"Ai…\n$ duration.min.     &lt;chr&gt; \"43\", \"37\", \"57\", \"48\", \"33\", \"48\", \"37\", \"46\", \"47\"…\n$ depth.m.          &lt;chr&gt; \"24,5\", \"17\", \"18,1\", \"16\", \"19\", \"25\", \"23\", \"21\", …\n\n\nThat’s a start. There’s well over 400 dives here. I’m impressed. The person has also recorded the location, coordinates, how they entered the water and the depth and time they were underwater. I would have expected to see the amount of gas they used, but we work with the data we have. A couple of the numbers I’d like to work with are saved as text. They’ll need to be converted before I can begin.\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\nDataset &lt;- Dataset |&gt; mutate(depth.m. = as.numeric(depth.m.)) |&gt;\n  mutate(duration.min. = as.numeric(duration.min.)) |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))\n\n\nOnce that sorted. I can get into the questions.\nThere are really two major questions I can get from a set like this. If I had them in person, I could ask about gear, their favourite dives, all sorts of things. But as it stands, my two big questions are:\n\nWhere have they been diving?\nHow much diving have they done?"

    "section": "Where have they been diving?",
    "text": "Where have they been diving?\nLet’s see where this diver has been. I’m going to look at this at a country level. This is partly for simplicity, and partly because personally, I want to dive in other countries so I want to see where this person has been.\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\nD&lt;-Dataset |&gt; select(country, id) |&gt; group_by(country) |&gt; \n  tally(name = \"no.dives\") |&gt;\n  rename(\"region\" = \"country\")\n\ncountry.dives&lt;-ggplot(D, mapping = aes(x = region, y = no.dives, fill = region))+\n  geom_col()+\n  ylab(\"Number of Dives\")+\n  xlab(\"Country\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Number of Dives in Each Country\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")\ncountry.dives&lt;-ggplotly(country.dives)\ncountry.dives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I think graphs, especially interactive ones like this are way better than plain text for communicating data. Like I’ve mentioned, it just communicates a lot more intuitively, at least it does for me. But there’s other ways to tell the same story. For example, I’m going to try something completely new, and communicate the same data above like this:\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\nworld&lt;-ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\nD&lt;-Dataset |&gt; select(country, id) |&gt; group_by(country) |&gt; \n  tally(name = \"no.dives\") |&gt;\n  rename(\"name\" = \"country\")\nmap.data&lt;-left_join(world, D, by=\"name\")\nfill.map&lt;-ggplot(map.data, aes(fill = no.dives, text = paste(\"Country: \", name, \" \\nDives\", no.dives)))+\n  geom_sf()+\n  ggtitle(\"Places this person has dived\")+\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"number of dives\", low = \"cyan\", high = \"blue\", na.value = \"white\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\nfill.map&lt;-ggplotly(fill.map, tooltip = \"text\")\nfill.map\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this is the best way to show the data. There are some caveats. I figured this out while coming up with the post, so there’s still a good deal of skill left to pick up. A huge part of my writing is being authentic though, so any readers (and myself) can see how far I come in the process.\nWith that said, let’s glance at the map itself. You can hover over it with your cursor to see the name and number of dives for a specific country. You can also click and select areas to zoom in for more detail. If you zoom into the Caribbean, you’ll find a few other sites that are hidden by size.\nIf I wasn’t sure before, I’m pretty sure this is a french diver now. Most dives are in France, and a good chunk of the rest are in fresh-speaking territories. They’ve gone overseas on some dive trips I would love to. Up until now, I’ve only dived in Jamaica, and not even everywhere here.\nJust from the sheer number of dives, I know this person is a far more advanced diver than me. I want to see some of the depths and times of their dives. As a PADI Advanced Open Water Diver, I’m currently limited to 40 metres deep. I have a suspicion this diver has gone a bit further with their training and skills.\n\n\nClick Here to see the code\ntime.and.depth&lt;-ggplot(Dataset, mapping = aes(x = depth.m., y = duration.min., colour = gas))+\n  geom_point()+\n  xlab(\"Depth (metres)\")+\n  ylab(\"Duration of dive (minutes)\")+\n  labs(title= \"Depth and Duration of Dives\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\ntime.and.depth&lt;-ggplotly(time.and.depth)\ntime.and.depth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here I can tell this is an advanced diver. Well, I could tell before, but this is confirmation. The number of dives is a huge indicator, but ignoring that, there are two things revealed here that give it away.\n\nThis diver has a number of gas mixes. With special training, divers can learn to use different air to affect how long they stay underwater.\nThis diver is pulling some crazy times and depths.\n\nThis diver is using air for some dives, those are the pink ones. And those fall into the range I’ve done and expect. Those dives are generally 40 metres or less, for under 100 minutes. They are also using Nitrox, a gas with more oxygen mix, and Trimix another altered gas.\nThe general rule is that it’s the nitrogen in your breathing gas that poses the most danger, so by changing that percentage, you can start to manage depths and times you never could on air. This definitely a more advanced diver, well beyond recreational limits."

But I do take note of some stuff not seen here like my gas consumption and animals I’ve seen. That would absolutely be great data to play with.\nBut also in the future, I’d love to go on dive trips like this. The rest of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico would be a great start, but diving the Mediterranean like this diver, and Indonesia would definitely be dreams come true.\nAnd you know what, I’ll do it. It will take planning, and saving, but I’ll do it.\nUntil next time, Walk Good"

In this dataset, there are 195 rows or records. Each one represents an individual country. There are also 35 columns or fields. Each field represents a specific observation. The function in R also gives me the names and data types of these fields. Lots of the fields appear to be country demographics and general information. There’s a lot to be judged here.\nAnd from this I can see the first issue. A lot of these fields that I would expect to be numbers are formatted as characters or text. Its not an impossible problem to fix, but if it’s not dealt with, it will make doing any analysis annoying at best and impossible at worst.\n\n\nCleaning 35 columns now, saves me a lot of heartache in the future. I won’t show it all but here are some examples of how I could do that.\n\ndataset&lt;- dataset |&gt; mutate (GDP = GDP |&gt; str_remove_all(\"[$,]\") |&gt; as.numeric())\ndataset$Density..P.Km2.&lt;-as.numeric(dataset$Density..P.Km2.)\n\nThankfully, there are more efficient ways to work\n\nc.names&lt;-colnames(dataset)\ncols.to.format&lt;-c.names[-c(1,3, 9, 13, 21, 25)]\ncols.that.can.stay&lt;-c.names[c(1,3, 9, 13, 21, 25)]\ndataset&lt;-dataset |&gt; \n  mutate(across(.cols = cols.to.format,.fns = ~str_remove_all(.x, \"[$,%]\")|&gt; \n                  as.numeric()))\n\nWhat I’ve done above is to convert all the relevant character or text fields/columns into numbers so I can work with them.\n\n\n\nNow comes the brainstorming. There’s a lot of data here. A lot of the questions that come to mind have to do with GDP. GDP, the gross domestic product, is essentially the dollar value of all the “Stuff” bought and sold in a country. You could also look at it as the country’s income. It’s not a perfect measure, but it can be useful. At the very least it gives me some questions to ask.\nThe questions that pop out to me are:\n\nHow does GDP relate to college enrollment?\nHow does Gasoline price relate to GDP?\nIs there any relationship between latitude, longitude and GDP?\nHow closely are CO2 emissions and GDP linked?\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start on the first one,\n\ngdp.vs.college&lt;-ggplot(dataset, mapping = aes(y = GDP, x = Gross.tertiary.education.enrollment...., colour = Country))+\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8)+\n    xlab(\"Gross College Enrollement\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP(USD)\")+\n  ggtitle(\"GDP and Gross College enrollment across countries\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\ngdp.vs.college&lt;-ggplotly(gdp.vs.college)\ngdp.vs.college\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there’s a problem or two here. These GDP’s have a huge range. Which makes sense, some of these countries have WAY more people that others, what makes sense might be comparing the income per person instead. This is the GDP per capita. From here on out, I’ll use GDP per capita, to account for those passive population differences.\n\ndataset&lt;- dataset |&gt; mutate(GDP.per.capita = round((GDP/Population), 2)) |&gt; na.omit()\ngdp.per.capita.vs.college&lt;-ggplot(dataset, mapping = aes(y = GDP.per.capita, x = Gross.tertiary.education.enrollment...., colour = Country))+\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8)+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)+\n  ggtitle(\"GDP Per capita and College enrollment in various countries\")+\n  xlab(\"Gross College Enrollement\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP per Capita (USD)\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n  \ngdp.per.capita.vs.college&lt;-ggplotly(gdp.per.capita.vs.college)\ngdp.per.capita.vs.college\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a little better. While its scattered, and there are definitely outliers, you can definitely see an upward trend. It looks like generally, more college enrollment means more income per person. But it also looks like the more people in college the greater the effect. I suppose it means there’s more people with more knowledge and skills to mix and use to generate income together by collaborating.\n\n\n\n\ngas.vs.gdp.per.capita&lt;-ggplot(dataset, mapping = aes(x = Gasoline.Price, y = GDP.per.capita, colour = Country))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  xlab(\"Gasoline Prices per litre\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP per Capita (USD)\")+\n  ggtitle('GDP per Capita and Gas Prices Around the World')+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\ngas.vs.gdp.per.capita&lt;-ggplotly(gas.vs.gdp.per.capita)\ngas.vs.gdp.per.capita\n\n\n\n\n\nThis relationship is actually a whole lot weaker than I imagined. I wish there was electricity price or some general energy price measure instead. The relationship between gas price and GDP isn’t too strong at all. Which is fine. Sometimes the answer to a question is just “there’s nothing much to see here”.\n\n\n\n\ncord&lt;- dataset |&gt; select(\"Latitude\", \"Longitude\", \"GDP.per.capita\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Latitude = abs(Latitude)) |&gt; mutate(Longitude = abs(Longitude)) |&gt;\n  na.omit()\ncor.matrix&lt;-cor(cord)\nggcorrplot(cor.matrix, type = \"upper\", lab = TRUE)+\n  labs(title = \"Correlation between Latitude, Longitude and GDP per Capita\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s not quite as much going on in this one. The GDP per capita is kind of correlated to the latitude. But I’ve seen stronger relationships. that number in red shows us that there is something there. The closer it is to 1 and redder that square, the stronger that relationship would be.\n\n\n\nMy question here is whether the CO2 emissions of a country are strongly related to its GDP. If working to produce things for income means more CO2, then it generally follows that countries with a higher GDP should emit more.\nI’ll start off looking graphically. I find its better for intuition.\n\nCO2.vs.gdp.per.capita&lt;-ggplot(dataset, mapping = aes(x = Co2.Emissions, y = GDP.per.capita, colour = Country))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())+\n  labs(title = \"GDP per Capita and CO2 Emissions for various countries\")+\n  xlab(\"CO2 Emissions in tonnes\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP per Capita in USD\")\nCO2.vs.gdp.per.capita&lt;-ggplotly(CO2.vs.gdp.per.capita)\nCO2.vs.gdp.per.capita\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph I can see a few things. Firstly, we have a few massive outliers. If you check the far right, we see China producing tons of CO2, and the US as well. Other countries are producing far less. We also have Liechtenstein, with a very high GDP per capita with pretty low emissions. For the most part though, countries are clustered towards relatively lower emissions.\nThere are a couple ways I can sort through this, I could remove the outliers. China’s huge emissions may just be because of its huge population. I could adjust by seeing what the CO2 per person is.\n\ndataset &lt;- dataset |&gt; mutate(co2.per.capita = Co2.Emissions/Population) |&gt; na.omit()\nco2.gdp.plot&lt;-dataset |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = co2.per.capita, y = GDP.per.capita, colour = Country))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())+\n  labs(title = \"GDP per Capita and CO2 Emissions per capita for various countries\")+\n  xlab(\"CO2 Emissions per capita in tonnes\")+\n  ylab(\"GDP per Capita in USD\")\n\nco2.gdp.plot&lt;-ggplotly(co2.gdp.plot)\nco2.gdp.plot\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’re seeing a little more detail. Correcting for the huge difference in populations made a difference. We see a general upward trend, but there are still plenty of outliers, and the relationship could be a lot stronger. There are ways to model and get more info in this relationships, but that’s a topic for later.\n\n\n\nSo, I’ll admit. This should be one of the first steps I took. In trying to put these posts out relatively fast and consistently, I may have rushed the process. There’s a life lesson in there somewhere. I could move this to the top, but I think I’ll leave it here. It will show my actual thought process as I went through this analysis, and be a reminder to go through more methodically next time. In fact, I’ll follow up with this exact data at some point in the future\nThis is a correlation matrix. I’ve used them before in my previous post here and I’m kind of fond of them. Essentially, it’s a graphical way to see how closely related two variables or properties or attributes are. It’s really applicable for numeric data, but on a dataset like this, doing one is invaluable.\n\nnumerics&lt;-dataset |&gt; select_if(is.numeric) |&gt; na.omit()\nnumerics&lt;-cor(numerics)\ngeneral.cor.plot&lt;-ggcorrplot(numerics, hc.order = TRUE, type = \"upper\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank())+\n  labs(title = \"General Correlations\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\ngeneral.cor.plot&lt;-ggplotly(general.cor.plot)\ngeneral.cor.plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “redder” the numbers, the more strongly related the variables are. For example two variables which are exactly the same would show up as the reddest. On the flip side, if two variables are related strongly, in opposite directions, they would show up the “Bluest”. These are “Negatively correlated.”\nBecause of how much data there is, I’ve opted to remove the labels and make the graph interactive. If you hover your mouse over a square, you should see the variables that are being compared.\nYou can see 3 clusters of red, showing areas of strongly related variables, and one major blue cluster showing variables which are negatively correlated. And from this there’s so many questions. Each of those clusters represent sets of relationships we could ask about. In fact, you can hover your mouse over the squares to see for yourself.\nJust hovering the mouse over each cluster:\n\nThe bottom red cluster has to do with relationships with “Birth stuff” like birth and fertility rates\nThe middle red cluster has to do with “Population size stuff”, including urban population, army size ect.\nThe top red cluster is more “Income and demographics stuff”, like minimum wage and life expectancy.\nThe blue cluster is “Birth Stuff’, connecting birth stuff to income and life expectancy\n\nSo you’ve seen my process at the moment, and some of the mistakes I’ve made. One day soon, you’ll see me re-attempt.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t still get those thoughts now. That being said, after a year, I think I have enough experience to share to those considering a similar path in Jamaica.

    "text": "Brief Summary\nSo, Just to give a brief rundown of the last year. Since graduating, I’ve started work with a Start-up in my field. There’s other posts around the blog (see here) about stuff i’ve done with the company. The start-up is Kee Farms, a relatively young company aiming to combat climate change through regenerative ocean farming. The company is young as well, so it’s as much of a leaning curve for me as it is for them. I’ve learned more about how things are done than the technical marine biology here.\nI’ve also done an internship with the Discovery Bay Marine Lab. This lab is located in St Ann, Jamaica. The lab has an internship program taking in two cycles of interns per year. Normally these include the recent graduates from the Marine Biology program at the University of the West Indies, but it is open to interested international students. This was one of my first times away from home for so long. It was also a chance to work with more seasoned Marine Biologists. The lab taught us quite a few skills and tools, but they also exposed us to research, teaching and outreach. In the process, the interns could get a feel of what worked best for us and what we gravitated towards.\nFinally, in the process, I’ve decided on a rough area of marine biology I’m interested in. I’ve suspected for a while where in marine biology I’d love to focus on in an ideal world. At the current moment, aquaculture is where my interest lies. I love the idea of putting knowledge to work, actually applying it to produce something, and aquaculture fits that perfectly right now. Time alone will tell how far I go with it, but I’m definitely going as of right now."

    "text": "What I Like\nI love that I’m in the field I’m passionate about. Honestly, more than that, I’m grateful for it. I know so many STEM students (especially those out of computing) who are nowhere near what they studied. Heck, one of my best friends studied bio medical engineering (building drugs and stuff) and is outside the field trying to break in. And that’s after migrating. STEM careers get a lot of hype, but especially in small developing countries, the fields are crowded. And its never that we don’t need developing in those STEM related areas, the space just never seems to materialise and its discouraging for so many of my cohort.\nI’ve managed to be on the water and in the water over the last year. I picked the field in part because I love the feeling of being out at sea. I don’t think I’m meant for a job permanently behind a desk. So I appreciate and I’m grateful for the fact I’ve gotten to go out on and under the water. The Discovery May Marine Lab was great for this, and to this day, most of my favourite marine memories are at (and under) the sea there.\nI’ve done hands on, practical work. Maybe this one’s part of being a covid student but I missed a chunk of my schooling experience due to the pandemic. I’m glad especially for the Discovery Bay internship, that helped me get out and do a lot of the nitty gritty work. I didn’t love all of it at the time, I don’t even love all of it now. But I appreciate that I got to make up for lost time. It was definitely a growing experience.\nBut beyond a shadow of a doubt, my favourite thing one year after graduating is that I can look back and see new skills I’ve cultivated over the year. I’m now an advanced open water diver. I’ve taught myself a good deal of R. I’ve learned to do a couple in water surveys. I can roughly ID some fish at a glance, way way more than I could a year ago. I did my first pitch for a company at PitchDeckJa. I pushed myself to do new things and honestly, I’m glad I did. The learning had just begun and even a year out of graduating, I have so much more learning to do."

    "section": "What I Don’t Like",
    "text": "What I Don’t Like\nThis is absolutely not all sunshine and rainbows though. There’s not a ton of organisations out there for science in developing countries like Jamaica. Someone I respect, with a few years more experience than me, from DBML has told me its absolutely getting better compared to back in his day, but there’s still only so much room.\nThat means a couple things. Firstly, there’s a good chance you’ll have to move more than you like. This may be within the country. I’ve seen some parts of Jamaica I’ve never seen before. But you still miss home if you are like me. If you’re less lucky, you may have to leave your country entirely.\nPersonally, developing and helping Jamaica means something to me. And leaving may be the best way to do that. But It may also mean you leave and never return to settle and contribute the way you want. Heck, I’m still coming to terms with that and trying to hold on.\nThe few organisations means you’re competing. Against your cohort yes, but also for funding. There’s only so much money to go around, especially if your science is more theoretical, or requires infrastructure which is lacking in your country. A good chunk of work may actually end up being just writing and calling and trying to figure out that funding.\nIts hard and its not for everyone. But for those who can (resource and ability wise), you may need to start something for yourself and create your own seat at the table so to speak. This is absolutely not easy, and not for everyone in the slightest. It may be needed though.\nFinally, related to that is people. You’ll have to deal with people regardless of what you do, but if you want to make your own seat at the table you’ll need to deal with it even more. I was sort of prepared for doing science…sort of. But I was unprepared for just managing the people and relationships that can grow up in a small field where everyone knows everyone. Again, I’m talking about marine biology in Jamaica, but I imagine it would be the same for a lot of other STEM fields in developing countries. It’s definitely not something I thought about off the top of my head."

    "text": "What I’d Change/Advice\nHere comes the last part. Advice. Here’s what I’d tell myself(or anyone where I was a year ago), about to graduate with my degree.\n\nKeep learning\nBe more than just a scientist\nReach out to people\n\nFirstly, keep learning. Graduating doesn’t mean you know everything. It doesn’t even mean you know most things. It means you’ve learned how you learn best, and have enough of a foundation to learn something else new. So keep learning. Pick up little bits from whatever you’re interested in and whatever opportunities come your way. That’s how you figure out where you’re going. Where I am right now, I’m considering dipping my toes into a whole other section of the biological sciences to enhance my existing skillset.\nOn that note, don’t just learn STEM stuff. We need scientists who are more than just scientists. I’m not proclaiming to be an expert but here are some of the top skills I think fresh grads should dip our feet into:\n\nWriting and communication: this is good for grants, proposal and getting your work out there. NEVER ever discount the skill of being able to tell a good story.\nBasics of finance/accounting: Sourcing and managing money to do your science(without being scammed)\nProject Management: Learn to approach and carry out projects(like research) in an organised way.\n\nFinally. talk to people. Offer to help with things. Even if its a cold message to someone you don’t know, put yourself out there aggressively. Let other people reject you, but don’t discount yourself. You’d be amazed how willing people are to talk to someone younger who seems to have a good head on their shoulders. You’d be even more surprised the benefit you can get from an experienced mentor who wants to see you succeed.\nFeel free to follow up. This post was to me a year ago, but its also for any upcoming grads in Jamaica or other developing countries. If you have any Questions, message me on Linkedln, Twitter, or my Email, and I will do my best to get back to you soon.\nWalk Good and Happy New Year."

Especially since talking about them lets me mention a couple of cool things.\nTurtle Crawle Bay is a place I’ve become familiar with over the last year.

And after a year working with the people there, I can confirm that’s more than just a tagline to them. The team by AHF works for community development, marine conservation and marine research.\nAHF has several initiatives they are a part of, you can check them out here, but what I want to mention specifically is their fish sanctuary, and their dive shop."

    "text": "East Portland Fish Sanctuary\nThe Foundation is partly responsible for the East Portland Fish Sanctuary. Technically, it’s “The East Portland Special Fisheries Conservation Area”, but I find sanctuary has a nicer ring to it.\nFor context, my country, Jamaica, has the most overfished water’s in the English speaking Caribbean. We are also a small island state where more than half of us live within 5km of the coast. With a mix like that, you can see that our fish populations are under serious pressure.\nAnd to that effect, Jamaica has established a number of Fish Sanctuaries. The basic idea is pretty simple. An area is designated a no take zone. Within the bounds of the sanctuary almost no fish can be legally taken. This means that the fish living inside have room to grow and mature and reproduce. Once these fish are of a sufficient size, they move out of the crowded sanctuary and are available to be fished and caught.\nIt’s a sustainability measure, and it improves fish numbers and size (or fish biomass) inside and directly outside the sanctuary. AHF’s sanctuary is among the larger ones in Jamaica and through working with the fishing community, they help ensure sustainability for generations to come.\nI did say almost no fish can be caught, with permission, one invasive species can be caught with the sanctuary. The lionfish. These guys aren’t native to the Caribbean, and eat a lot of our native species, so to control their numbers we return the favour and eat them back. I can personally confirm that they are delicious.\n\n\n\nConfirmation that Lionfish is Delicious"

Personally and regrettably, I’m so busy working whenever I go that I’ve never had time to dive with them myself. But its very much something I’d love to do and am looking forward to when the opportunity comes.\n\n\n\nMe working at AHF instead of diving\n\n\nThe dive shop, which you can check out more of at their website or their instagram, offers dive excursions throughout the sanctuary. As a sanctuary, the area has more fish and larger fish then you would see in the surrounding areas. The area is also teeming with other wildlife. I’ve seen rays and turtles just passing by while I’m above water on the boat.\n\n\n\nThe beautiful blue waters at San San in the Sanctuary. You may see a turtle if you look closely\n\n\nI’m a simple diver, a reef with lots of pretty fish already gets me excited. But this dive shop also has even more special attractions I’m dying to jump in the water and see.\nFirst is their underwater statue garden. They have a number of statues underwater for us scuba divers to explore. It’s the only one in Jamaica and I can’t wait to dive it. All I need is time, an opportunity and a few good dive buddies.\nThe second is a little newer. There was recently a wreck sunk in the sanctuary, the SS Bogle. This decommissioned Jamaica Defence Force ship was sunk in the sanctuary, and now serves as an artificial reef, with fish coming in to colonise and live there. I’ve done a wreck dive before on my advanced open water certification, and I loved that experience. I’m absolutely jumping at the chance to dive this wreck as soon as I can.\nMy favourite dive site is Rio Bueno near Discovery Bay, Jamaica, I’m hoping diving with Lady G’ will change that.\n\n\n\nMy Last Wreck Dive, a 10/10 experience\n\n\nThere’s also water sports like glass-bottom boat rides over the reef, kayaking and snorkeling for the non divers among us. Of course you could get certified at the dive shop, and become a diver like me.\nI promise I’ll review diving in the sanctuary as soon as I do it. You’ll be seeing pics, hearing my thoughts and everything.\nAnd I haven’t even mentioned what may be the best thing about AHF yet. I love the team working there. I’ve made friends with the staff and team there. They’re just really cool, solid people and they’re out there working to protect and sustain the sea like me.\nI haven’t mentioned everything, like their outreach activities, or their turtle hatching program, or their amazing coral nursery and planting. But even just from this you can tell I have nothing but praise and good vibes for the team at AHF and the amazing work they do.\nUntil next time, walk good."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On this blog post I want to talk about connection. This will, admittedly, be a bit of a strange post. It’s something I’ve never really done before, mixing in my Marine Biology with a little…lets call it philosophy.\nI was trained as a marine biologist. As anyone who knows me, or who has taken a look around the blog should be able to tell. But the truth is marine biology is just the study of living things in the sea. There’s a hundred and one ways to approach it.\nVery broadly, If i had to condense down my training, I’d say I was trained as an ecologist. What ecologists primarily focus on is the interaction between living things and their non living environments. I was trained with a focus towards how the oceans’ living things and environment interact, and consequently, how they are connected. Just to be clear, that is still a super broad area of knowledge, but it is a starting off point.\n\n\n\nA simple food web, showing how livings things connect, directly or indirectly\n\n\nPicture of a Marine Ecosystem and food web\nNothing in nature exists in a vacuum. Everything is connected, whether directly or indirectly. The matter we are made up of right now has been cycling, from place to place and organism to organism for thousands of years. The energy we’re running on flows from the sun, to other organisms to us. In short, we are all connected. In fact, if you take a wide enough view, pretty much everything is connected.\nIn fact, what we think of as “a single thing”, very rarely is. There’s a concept in biology called symbiosis, where two organisms interact particularly closely, to the benefit of (at least) one. Organisms we consider one, often have bacteria and microbes which play a small(or large) part in keeping that organism running smoothly. Tree’s associate with fungi to extend their roots, and corals associate with algae to provide their food.\nThe truth is, everything is connected, and nothing truly exists in isolation. That’s not just the plants an animals. The more I grow, the more I realise the field itself has tons of connections.\nAfter all, marine biology involves knowing about the water(chemistry), the land below the sea(geography), the physics of water 30 metres down(especially as a diver) and the microbes in the sea and sand(microbiology). Biotechnology is an increasingly important part of the space, and as with everything else, economics plays a role.\n\n\n\nAll these fields are connected in ocean science. Its basically impossible to do one without touching another\n\n\nBeing a marine biologist, trying to be a good one, has meant knowing a bit about all of these. I’ll need to keep learning, no question. And yet, there’s only so much one person can know well.\nOne of the big things I picked up from the Econ minor is the value of specialisation. We do our best, by focusing on something, and doing it extremely well. Then, when we collaborate, we accomplish far more than we could do on our own.\nThat’s where networks and teamwork comes in. As a proud West Indian, I have to mention the Caribbean Aquaculture Hub. It was the idea of Dr. Julie Russo, someone I know personally and have great respect for. She saw the very real need to bring together all the scattered skills, professionals and stakeholders in aquaculture across the Caribbean and world. After a little more than a year in the caribbean and marine science space, I see just how needed this is.\n\n\n\nLogo for the Caribbean Aquaculture Hub\n\n\nA network like this allows people to share knowledge and build on what others are doing far more effectively. It would allow people to connect with specialists and new ideas in a way that innovates and new ways of doing aquaculture that work best for our region. It would give a united front to approach governments or companies abroad. And it would make it easier for the natural potential and talent of us Caribbean people to be truly utilised.\nSo I’m giving of my time. I’ll be taking an active role with the students and young people in the organisation. I want to help build this community that will make things better for me and all of the young up and coming Caribbean scientists. I want to help bring together not just marine scientists like me, but all the other areas we are connected to, to create a resilient, highly productive ecosystem for Caribbean Aquaculture and Marine Science.\nAnd hey, If this is something you want to be a part of reach out to me here or here or the network itself. It doesn’t matter if you’re a student, professional or just find it cool. After all, we’re all connected, and its going to be that connection(with people in the space, and ones we traditonally think of as outside), that’s going to create something strong and beautiful."

    "text": "What do I like to read?\nSo I suppose the best place to start is what I’ve been reading, and what I like to read. I was a fiction reader, especially as a child. One of the most memorable book series I went through was Percy Jackson and the Olympians(which has recently gotten a Disney plus show I rather enjoyed).\n\n\n\nThe cover of the book that really started me off\n\n\n\nI love fantasy. Fantasy based on old myths and legends has a special place in my heart. I think there’s a couple reasons:\n\nMy father is still a huge reader and lover of fantasy, so I’m predisposed by nature and nurture.\nI love the idea of building on and using old legends.\nI love the world building.\nI love the grand scale of everything.\nAnd I love how human and relateable the struggles can be, despite the scales and different worlds the writers create.\n\nThat said, what I like to read is not the only thing I’ve been reading since I got back on the reading train. I’ve made an effort to do two things:\n\nAcademic Reading\nReading Wider\n\nI’ll address the second one first."

    "section": "Reading Wider",
    "text": "Reading Wider\nI’ve made an effort to read things I wouldn’t normally read. It’s important to broaden your perspectives after all. I’ve read books on personal development like The Four Agreements and Mastery. I’ve read a little bit on one of Jamaica’s National Heroes, my personal favourite, Marcus Garvey for the first time. It turns out he said a lot I agree with and a lot I don’t.\nI’ve read books that are “classic” and hard to qualify like Meditations. And of course I’ve read my fiction as well. Neil Gaiman’s Anansi Boys is probably my favourite book so far, although comparing fiction to non fiction is like apples and oranges. Separate from books like these, I’ve made an effort to read…\n\nAcademic Reading\nI’ve asked around online for good ways to keep growing and learning after finishing university. It’s something I was really concerned about. I want to keep improving, and not be an “ok” marine biologist, but the best one can I be. At the same time, I’m very aware of how easy it is to stagnate, or worse forget what you aren’t actively using. So I’ve made an effort to find some material in my field(marine biology, specifically aquaculture), and try to read through a couple papers a week.\nI decided to try and keep the number low so I can actually engage with them properly. Occasionally I stray outside the field(usually somewhere adjacent), but I’m glad to say I’m being pretty consistent. I’ve put in my own money and subscribed to a journal and I’ve not regretted it yet.\nOne thing I’ve taken to doing is using an online tool called Notion, to help me keep track. Notion is huge, and can do a lot of things. It is potentially a very big system, but to be honest, all I use it for right now is as a library for the literature I read. It’s also free(or I use a free version which has pretty much everything but limits sharing).\nI use this template some kind soul came up with online and record the titles, links and broad topics of the papers I’ve read. Then I’ll write my summaries, insights and ideas into the program, and everything will get stored online. I personally find summarising and engaging like that makes me remember more than just glancing through passively.\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the library where I keep papers i have read, with summaries and citations."

    "text": "What Have I realised?\nI’ve realised a couple things, but it boils down to “I learn a lot when I read.” And I mean that generally. Academic writing is the obvious one, science is cool. But I’m shocked just how much people have done that I have not and would not have heard of otherwise. The knowledge is out there, just waiting for someone to tap it. Maybe you can do something practical with it like I hope to, but you can definitely learn.\nBut I learn a lot from fiction too. It’s like meeting the characters(and the authors). I’d argue some of the personal development I’ve seen in/learned from characters is as important and useful as the advice in any self help book. There’s a reason children are taught with stories. We relate to them in a way we just do not seem to when simply told something."

    "text": "What Would I Recommend?\nI recommend reading. There’s a lot of knowledge out there in books and articles, so much out there its almost crazy. But I fell off myself. I acknowledge reading can be fun and rewarding, but I’d be a liar to say It can’t be tedious too. So here’s what I did:\n\nStart Small\nI made sure not to take up too much. I stuck to 2 papers a week academically. One so I could engage properly. But also so that I don’t miss the goal, get discouraged and stop all together.\n\n\nConsistency\nI have a timer set to remind me to read at 6:00pm on weekdays. I have preset alarm for half an hour, the time I’ve decided to read for. Sometimes(often) I end up reading outside the timeslot or for more(or less) time. But the secret is just to keep at it. Even tedious books get worn away with time. That said, tedious books will burn you out. Even moreso if you don’t already have a good relationship with reading. So…\n\n\nRead what you Enjoy!\nThis is the closest thing to a secret. We enjoy what we enjoy, so find something you enjoy to read. It’s easiest to build habits with something you like or something rewarding. Maybe you have a favourite series based on a book, you can start there. Or find some easy reading, whatever that means to you. Don’t feel any sort of way that your choice is silly. Its a story you like, that’s valuable enough.\nWith that said, I’m going to keep reading. I hope you start or continue too. Walk good and happy reading."

I’m going to use this platform, as another way to get the word out there.\nJust a disclaimer, I’ve only seen a nurse shark once in the water and didn’t photograph it. As such all of the images here are borrowed from the internet, credit for them goes to the photographers, not me."

    "text": "So, What do we do?\nI’m doing my best to learn to be solution oriented. This post is to educate, but education should go into doing things to help make the world better. So here’s a short list of some things we can do.\n\nGo visit an aquarium. Go see for yourself. Tons of them have sharks in tanks with other fish, kinda disproves the whole “eats anything in front of it” myth. Ask questions about them. Learn more.\nShare articles and stories like these. Talk to people who know a bit about sharks. Start chipping away at that fear of the unknown.\nTell better stories. I’ve been harping on the fact that media portrayal has a lot to do with how we see sharks. But we have the power to tell better stories. Heroic sharks… shark stories like that could do as much good for the sharks’ image as works like “Flipper”, “Free Willy” or “A Dolphin’s tale.\n\nSo let’s try to learn a little more, so we can fear a little less about sharks. They are worthy of a healthy respect, so you and I can start by giving them that respect and letting it take the place of the fear.\nWalk good."

    "text": "Setting the Stage\nLet’s start off with the basics. What is coral? Despite looking like a rock, Coral is an animal (technically a colony of animals). Corals are closely related to jellyfish, and while there are tons of corals, when scientists say it, they are typically referring to hard, stony corals. When I say corals these are what I’m referring to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA collage of Atlantic coral from online. Corals differ by ocean and I now subconsciously look if I’m seeing corals I recognize anytime I see coral\n\n\nCorals are found in the tropics, so areas like my home Jamaica traditionally have coasts full of coral. They have reasonably strict living requirements:\n\nCorals prefer warm(but not hot) water\nThey need clear sunlight, and so prefer shallow water\nSeawater without any freshwater\nWater with sufficient Calcium to build their skeletons\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Distribution of coral reefs, you can see they love the tropics\n\n\nThey tend to accumulate in coral reefs, rocky formations which, personally I think are the most beautiful environment in the sea. These reefs are formed by corals growing atop each other."

    "text": "Why do these matter?\nNot only are these reefs absolutely gorgeous, they are homes. The nooks and crannies made by the corals growing serve as habitat for the fish and other organisms that live on the reef.\n\n\n\nA colony of Porites/finger coral I photographed with sponges growing on it\n\n\nAnd believe me, There’s a lot of organisms on the reef, the usually quoted figure is that 25% or 1 in 4 marine animals spend some part of their lives on the reef. That includes tons of the fish we eat. In fact, here in my home country at least, pretty much all our traditional fish are reef dwellers.\n\n\n\nA School of blue chromis a 100 feet down. 1 in every 4 marine animals live on coral reefs at some point in their lives\n\n\nThis seems like a good place to talk about another thing corals do. While they are animals (I wouldn’t lie to you), they do look like rocks. They are tough enough to break waves coming in to shore. I’ve been on both sides of a reef helping students and we can all confirm, the forereef (the side facing out to the deep sea) is way rougher than the backreef (where the waves have been broken). This applies to regular waves, but also storm surges. A healthy reef protects what’s behind it, and what’s behind it is often our land and home and buildings.\nSo by now, you can see corals help give fish(or seafood) places to live and grow, and protect the shore from storms and harsh waves. That’s already plenty. But I’ve mentioned they’re gorgeous, and people (like me), will pay money to go dive and see the reef and its residents.\nSo it seems like corals are a win-win-win. Which means this is where I drop the bad news."

    "text": "The Bad News\nRemember when I said coral was an animal? It is, but its also more. If you want to get technical, what we refer to as coral is usually a partnership between a jellyfish-like animal (polyp), and tiny plants (zooxanthellae or dinoflagellates). The plants give the coral its gorgeous colour, and provide it with food. In exchange, the corals provide them with homes and protection. And those plants do that job really well. Under normal circumstances, the plants provide all the energy the coral needs and it barely has to feed on things drifting by in the water with its tentacles. Those plants are the reason the corals need clear, shallow water and plenty of sunlight.\nBut it can backfire. When temperatures get too hot, or the corals are otherwise stressed they eject their tiny plants. Like I said, the plants give them their vibrant colour, so they turn a haunting, bony pale white when they are lost, a process called bleaching. They don’t die immediately, and if the stressor subsides, they can even take back up new plants into their cells. But if it persists. They will die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBleached staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis. It looks haunting, but can spell death for the reef. I didn’t take this picture, which is good since I’d likely be heartbroken\n\n\nAnd reefs take centuries to grow. The heat contributes to bleaching. In recent years, we’ve had bleaching events back to back to back. I will likely never see a reef the way my mentors did, and yet, that I may be one of the last divers to see a live reef.\nWe’re fighting back. The scientists, conservationists and other groups are trying, I personally know several who are, but Its a scary and sobering thought that I may be one of the last humans to dive a reef, and see an ecosystem that quite literally built and sheltered my island."
